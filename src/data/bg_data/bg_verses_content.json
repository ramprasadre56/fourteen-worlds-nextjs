Duryodhana pointed out this mistake of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s so that he might be alert and uncompromising in the fighting. By this he wanted to point out also that he should not be similarly lenient in battle against the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were also Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s affectionate students.

Duryodhana also warned that such leniency in the fight would lead to defeat.\n\nDuryodhana, a great diplomat, wanted to point out the defects of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, the greatbr\u0101hma\u1e47acommander in chief. Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya had some political quarrel with King Drupada, the father of Draupad\u012b, who was Arjuna\u2019s wife. As a result of this quarrel, Drupada performed a great sacrifice, by which he received the benediction of having a son who would be able to kill Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya knew this perfectly well, and yet as a liberalbr\u0101hma\u1e47ahe did not hesitate to impart all his military secrets when the son of Drupada, Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna, was entrusted to him for military education. Now, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna took the side of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and it was he who arranged for their military phalanx, after having learned the art from Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. Duryodhana pointed out this mistake of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s so that he might be alert and uncompromising in the fighting. By this he wanted to point out also that he should not be similarly lenient in battle against the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were also Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s affectionate students. Arjuna, especially, was his most affectionate and brilliant student. Duryodhana also warned that such leniency in the fight would lead to defeat.",

In such a blind conception of life, they forget even the causes of material happiness.

Arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives. He thinks that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he is not willing to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration. But as ak\u1e63atriya,he requires a kingdom for his subsistence, because thek\u1e63atriyascannot engage themselves in any other occupation. But Arjuna has no kingdom. Arjuna\u2019s sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lies in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited from his father, which he does not like to do. Therefore he considers himself fit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration.\n\nWithout knowing that one\u2019s self-interest is in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), conditioned souls are attracted by bodily relationships, hoping to be happy in such situations. In such a blind conception of life, they forget even the causes of material happiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for ak\u1e63atriya.It is said that two kinds of men, namely thek\u1e63atriyawho dies directly in front of the battlefield under K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal orders and the person in the renounced order of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual culture, are eligible to enter into the sun globe, which is so powerful and dazzling. Arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives. He thinks that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he is not willing to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration. But as ak\u1e63atriya,he requires a kingdom for his subsistence, because thek\u1e63atriyascannot engage themselves in any other occupation. But Arjuna has no kingdom.

Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite befitting any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person.

This kind of saintliness, however, is not for ak\u1e63atriya.Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be cowardly. For example, Lord R\u0101ma was so saintly that people even now are anxious to live in the kingdom of Lord R\u0101ma (r\u0101ma-r\u0101jya), but Lord R\u0101ma never showed any cowardice.

In Arjuna\u2019s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna\u2019s addressing of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as \u201cM\u0101dhava,\u201d or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that, as the husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune.

Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in theUpani\u1e63ads,will continue eternally. This statement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s is authoritative because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality were not a fact, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would not have stressed it so much \u2013 even for the future. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b may argue that the individuality spoken of by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not spiritual, but material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s individuality? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then HisBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing. TheG\u012bt\u0101is above such literature. No mundane book compares with theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.When one accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man, theG\u012bt\u0101loses all importance. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great\u0101c\u0101ryaslike \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m\u0101nuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in theG\u012bt\u0101that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature. The nondevotee\u2019s approach to the teachings of theG\u012bt\u0101is something like that of a bee licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can theG\u012bt\u0101be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b explanation of theG\u012bt\u0101is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of theG\u012bt\u0101.If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed by theVedasas above mentioned.\n\nThe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering ofm\u0101y\u0101,or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in theUpani\u1e63ads,will continue eternally. This statement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s is authoritative because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality were not a fact, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would not have stressed it so much \u2013 even for the future. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b may argue that the individuality spoken of by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not spiritual, but material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s individuality? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then HisBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing. TheG\u012bt\u0101is above such literature. No mundane book compares with theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.When one accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man, theG\u012bt\u0101loses all importance. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great\u0101c\u0101ryaslike \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m\u0101nuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in theG\u012bt\u0101that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature. The nondevotee\u2019s approach to the teachings of theG\u012bt\u0101is something like that of a bee licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can theG\u012bt\u0101be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b explanation of theG\u012bt\u0101is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of theG\u012bt\u0101.If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed by theVedasas above mentioned.",

The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul passes away from this position, the activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul.

Owing to a gross material conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matters for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps they have no idea that one must think of the soul, and thus make a solution to the material miseries.\n\nSome people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the position of the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective functions and relationships and all other major and minor details. And it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects. But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul, then one\u2019s life is successful.\n\nSome people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude.

Except for work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all activities are abominable because they continually bind the worker to the cycle of birth and death. One should therefore never desire to be the cause of work. Everything should be done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Misers do not know how to utilize the assets of riches which they acquire by good fortune or by hard labor. One should spend all energies working in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and that will make one\u2019s life successful. Like misers, unfortunate persons do not employ their human energy in the service of the Lord.",

In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one comes directly into communion with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus all directions from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may be understood in that transcendental state. One is sure to achieve results by such activities and attain conclusive knowledge. One has only to carry out the orders of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His representative, the spiritual master.",

If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants, the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not want, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction. Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This consciousness is the causeless mercy of the Lord, which the devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached to the sensual platform.",

Demigods like Indra, Candra and Varu\u1e47a are appointed officers who manage material affairs, and theVedasdirect sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, offer food to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then eat \u2013 a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who eats only food offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by acceptingpras\u0101damof the Lord (food offered to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.\n\n\u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a, a great commentator on theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,writes as follows:ye indr\u0101dy-a\u1e45gatay\u0101vasthita\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a\u1e41 sarve\u015bvara\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47um abhyarcya tac-che\u1e63am a\u015bnanti tena tad deha-y\u0101tr\u0101\u1e41 samp\u0101dayanti, te santa\u1e25 sarve\u015bvarasya yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63asya bhakt\u0101\u1e25 sarva-kilbi\u1e63air an\u0101di-k\u0101la-viv\u1e5bddhair \u0101tm\u0101nubhava-pratibandhakair nikhilai\u1e25 p\u0101pair vimucyante.The Supreme Lord, who is known as theyaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a,or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of all the demigods, who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole.

The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals.

It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when they are spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself.

He is like thevaid\u016bryastone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of theVedas(vede\u1e63u durlabham adurlabham \u0101tma-bhaktau). Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101to the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part-and-parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in theBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in theG\u012bt\u0101cannot be understood by demonic brains. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change Hissac-cid-\u0101nandabody. He isadvaita,which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit \u2013 whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And because the Lord\u2019s body and self are identical, His position is always different from that of the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse.\n\nIn theVedasalso it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, manifests Himself in innumerable forms.

If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains Hisprak\u1e5bti,or His form.Prak\u1e5btimeans \u201cnature,\u201d as well assvar\u016bpa,or \u201cone\u2019s own form.\u201d The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. And although His body does not deteriorate like a material body, it still appears that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth. But astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation \u2013 past, present and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance are like the sun\u2019s rising, moving before us and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun has set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency \u2013 and He is never contaminated by material nature. TheVedasalso confirm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn yet He still appears to take His birth in multimanifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body. In theBh\u0101gavatam,He appears before His mother as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, bestowed upon the living entities so that they can concentrate on the Supreme Lord as He is, and not on mental concoctions or imaginations, which the impersonalist wrongly thinks the Lord\u2019s forms to be. The wordm\u0101y\u0101,or\u0101tma-m\u0101y\u0101,refers to the Lord\u2019s causeless mercy, according to theVi\u015bva-ko\u015badictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body.

From theBh\u0101gavatamwe understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of theVedas.Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in theVedas,people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared in order to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and everyavat\u0101ra,or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as anavat\u0101raunless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same \u2013 to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion.

From theBh\u0101gavatamwe understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of theVedas.Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in theVedas,people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared in order to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and everyavat\u0101ra,or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as anavat\u0101raunless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same \u2013 to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form.\n\nThe principles of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true in the beginner\u2019s arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness everywhere. Such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.\n\nThe principles of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world.

And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality.

Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God\u2019s different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many.

These demigods are all living entities (nity\u0101n\u0101m) with different grades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme God \u2013 N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, orp\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b.Even the great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva (\u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism.Iha devat\u0101\u1e25denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. But N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. Even \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people (h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101na) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods and their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, people worship the demigods or powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or \u201cbig guns\u201d in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are not interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worshiping empowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They are mostly interested in material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity.\n\nThere is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God\u2019s different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. TheVedassay,nityo nity\u0101n\u0101m:God is one.\u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25.The Supreme God is one \u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods are all living entities (nity\u0101n\u0101m) with different grades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme God \u2013 N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, orp\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b.Even the great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva (\u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism.Iha devat\u0101\u1e25denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. But N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. Even \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people (h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101na) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods and their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, people worship the demigods or powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or \u201cbig guns\u201d in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things.

Arjuna is here advised to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, following in the footsteps of the Lord\u2019s previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, as mentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well as those of persons who acted in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the past. Therefore He recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some millions of years before. All such students of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are mentioned here as past liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of duties allotted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nThere are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full of dirty things can take to the line of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for a gradual cleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby be benefited. Foolish persons or neophytes in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness often want to retire from activities without having knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

In theYoga-s\u016btraof Pata\u00f1jali, the soul is calledpratyag-\u0101tm\u0101andpar\u0101g-\u0101tm\u0101.As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is calledpar\u0101g-\u0101tm\u0101,but as soon as the same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is calledpratyag-\u0101tm\u0101.The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Pata\u00f1jali system ofyogainstructs one on how to control the functions of the body\u2019s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment.

In theYoga-s\u016btraof Pata\u00f1jali, the soul is calledpratyag-\u0101tm\u0101andpar\u0101g-\u0101tm\u0101.As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is calledpar\u0101g-\u0101tm\u0101,but as soon as the same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is calledpratyag-\u0101tm\u0101.The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Pata\u00f1jali system ofyogainstructs one on how to control the functions of the body\u2019s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment.

By this advancement in life, not only does one become happy and opulent in this life, but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging into the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

Having forgotten that purpose since time immemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one is engaged in transcendental service through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they become forgetful of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When, however, such deluded living entities become situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as confirmed in theBh\u0101gavatam(2.10.6):muktir hitv\u0101nyath\u0101-r\u016bpa\u1e41 svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25.Liberation means to be situated in one\u2019s constitutional position as an eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness).\n\nFor want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Thisyogahas two divisions of sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one\u2019s material possessions, and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of one\u2019s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such sacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one\u2019s own self (or one\u2019s constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the path ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial, for such a person can easily understand the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of theG\u012bt\u0101is faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in forgoing material possessions, in studying theVedasand in partaking of the social institution calledvar\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,but one who doubts the authority of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a falls back. One is therefore advised to studyBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,or any other scripture, under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101have come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as it is expressed in theG\u012bt\u0101itself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path.

Owing only to forgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and therefore suffers. By K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can revive his real position and thus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, when one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities.

Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious spiritual master. One can know God and one\u2019s relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation.

Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious spiritual master. One can know God and one\u2019s relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day, when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge.",

A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact withm\u0101y\u0101(illusion) due to the desire to lord it overm\u0101y\u0101,and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one\u2019s practical performance of duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence of desire and anger.

A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not eat anything which is not first offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, only the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can attain perfection inyogapractice. Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of fasting, practiceyoga.The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person observes fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat more than is required, and he is thus competent to performyogapractice. One who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a great deal. Such a person cannot performyoga.\n\nRegulation of diet and sleep is recommended herein for theyog\u012bs.Too much eating means eating more than is required to keep the body and soul together. There is no need for men to eat animals, because there is an ample supply of grains, vegetables, fruits and milk. Such simple foodstuff is considered to be in the mode of goodness according to theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.Animal food is for those in the mode of ignorance. Therefore, those who indulge in animal food, drinking, smoking and eating food which is not first offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will suffer sinful reactions because of eating only polluted things.Bhu\u00f1jate te tv agha\u1e41 p\u0101p\u0101 ye pacanty \u0101tma-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101t.Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself, not offering his food to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, eats only sin.

Therefore spirit and matter, which combine to manifest this gigantic universal form, are originally two energies of the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original cause of everything. A fragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely the living entity, may be the cause of a big skyscraper, a big factory, or even a big city, but he cannot be the cause of a big universe. The cause of the big universe is the big soul, or the Supersoul. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme, is the cause of both the big and small souls. Therefore He is the original cause of all causes. This is confirmed in theKa\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad(2.2.13).Nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m.",

Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wanting some particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example, a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a person wanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvat\u012b; and a person wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Um\u0101, the wife of Lord \u015aiva. In this way there are recommendations in the\u015b\u0101stras(Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of different demigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and so he successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of all living entities, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods.

Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from material contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.\n\nHere the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated.

In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembers instructing Vivasv\u0101n, the sun-god, millions of years ago. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows every living entity because He is situated in every living being\u2019s heart as the Supersoul. But despite His presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the less intelligent, even if able to realize the impersonal Brahman, cannot realize \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Person. Certainly the transcendental body of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not perishable. He is just like the sun, andm\u0101y\u0101is like a cloud. In the material world we can see that there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon and stars are not actually covered. Similarly,m\u0101y\u0101cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the less intelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this chapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to become perfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, he cannot possibly understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without being in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nUnlike the ordinary human being, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says that He completely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will happen in the future.

When the living entity is in material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material world. That is calledkarma,or varied creation by the force of material consciousness.\n\nIn Vedic literature the living entity is calledj\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101and Brahman, but he is never called Para-brahman. The living entity (j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101) takes different positions \u2013 sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies himself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior, spiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord\u2019s marginal energy. According to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In material nature he is manifested sometimes as a man, demigod, animal, beast, bird, etc., according to hiskarma.To attain material heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yaj\u00f1a), but when his merit is exhausted he returns to earth again in the form of a man. This process is calledkarma.\n\nIn Vedic literature the living entity is calledj\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101and Brahman, but he is never called Para-brahman.

The five kinds of fire are conceived of as the heavenly planets, clouds, the earth, man and woman, and the five kinds of sacrificial offerings are faith, the enjoyer on the moon, rain, grains and semen.\n\nTheCh\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63addescribes the Vedic sacrificial process.

When the merit of sacrifice is exhausted, the living entity descends to earth in the form of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material path. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to Godhead.\n\nIn the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them.

Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman assumes the form ofj\u012bvais not acceptable.

If one is transcendentally absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not material. Therefore the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare is the best process for successfully changing one\u2019s state of being at the end of one\u2019s life.",

But actually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If it is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge.

These activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.\n\nThis knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as explained in Vedic literature. In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47a,man\u2019s sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For instance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant, then it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers and bears fruit, and, when it is complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still to be enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit, which we are enjoying as distress and pain.\n\nThis knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as explained in Vedic literature.

In other words, those who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions.

Therefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and it is calledpavitram uttamam,the purest.Uttamameans transcendental.Tamasmeans this material world or darkness, anduttamameans that which is transcendental to material activities. Devotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar with devotional service will know that they are not material activities.

Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees for their permission, and when they gave it N\u0101rada ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions.

Devotional service consists of\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25,so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized\u0101c\u0101ryas.Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can execute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says,patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toyam:He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be offered byanyperson, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many instances in history. Simply by tasting thetulas\u012bleaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanat-kum\u0101ra became great devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.\n\nThe process of devotional service is a very happy one (su-sukham). Why?

It is not as the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers claim. Although they sometimes take to so-called devotional service, their idea is that as long as they are not liberated they will continue their devotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they will \u201cbecome one with God.\u201d Such temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional service. Actual devotional service continues even after liberation. When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord.\n\nIt is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers claim.

After one is liberated, when one is situated in the Brahman position (brahma-bh\u016bta), one\u2019s devotional service begins (sama\u1e25 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u mad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m).

By these yogic methods one may make a little progress towardbhakti-yoga,but without coming to the stage of devotional service one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process of devotional service, especially by hearing\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamorBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101from realized souls, then he can understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the science of God.Eva\u1e41 prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogata\u1e25.When one\u2019s heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one can understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty.

As stated in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(4.31.14),\n\nyath\u0101 taror m\u016bla-ni\u1e63ecanenat\u1e5bpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopa\u015b\u0101kh\u0101\u1e25pr\u0101\u1e47opah\u0101r\u0101c ca yathendriy\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41tathaiva sarv\u0101rha\u1e47am acyutejy\u0101\n\n\u201cBy giving water to the root of a tree one satisfies its branches, twigs and leaves, and by supplying food to the stomach one satisfies all the senses of the body.

If one is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith.\n\n\u201cBy giving water to the root of a tree one satisfies its branches, twigs and leaves, and by supplying food to the stomach one satisfies all the senses of the body.

If one is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith.\n\nNow, the development of that faith is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. There are three divisions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious men. In the third class are those who have no faith. Even if they are officially engaged in devotional service, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most probably they will slip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because they haven\u2019t complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to continue in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a little well situated they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It is only by faith that one can advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As far as the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a first-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And in the second class are those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have firm faith thatk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-bhakti,or service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the best course and so in good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the third class, who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class he does not fall down, and for the first-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness there is no chance of falling down. One in the first class will surely make progress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very good, he has not yet gained adequate knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through the scriptures like\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamandBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.Sometimes these third-class persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness have some tendency towardkarma-yogaandj\u00f1\u0101na-yoga,and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection ofkarma-yogaorj\u00f1\u0101na-yogais vanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also divided into three stages and described in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.First-class attachment, second-class attachment and third-class attachment are also explained in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamin the Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it is simply eulogy, find the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional service. For them there is very little hope of gaining perfection. Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service.\n\nNow, the development of that faith is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

He is the master of the material energy. As has been explained in several places (mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101), He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this material energy.

The biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. Actually, although He is controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning Hisyogam ai\u015bvaram,His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who appears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.\n\nNor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy.

These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being.\n\nSome of those who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who are infected with the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy quote the following verse from the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(3.29.21)to prove that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just an ordinary man.Aha\u1e41 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u bh\u016bt\u0101tm\u0101vasthita\u1e25 sad\u0101:\u201cThe Supreme is present in every living entity.\u201d We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u0101c\u0101ryaslike J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, commenting on this verse, says that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in His plenary expansion as Param\u0101tm\u0101, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to thearc\u0101-m\u016brti,the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the temple than to other devotees, so Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present in everyone\u2019s heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101, every body is the embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in which the Param\u0101tm\u0101 dwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected.\n\nSome of those who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who are infected with the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy quote the following verse from the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(3.29.21)to prove that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just an ordinary man.Aha\u1e41 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u bh\u016bt\u0101tm\u0101vasthita\u1e25 sad\u0101:\u201cThe Supreme is present in every living entity.\u201d We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u0101c\u0101ryaslike J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected.\n\nThere are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows that although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as confirmed in theBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101.Although His personal abode is Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and He is always staying there, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation.\n\nThere are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship.

Whatever we want to know through theVedasis but a progressive step toward understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That subject matter which helps us purify our constitutional position is especially K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, the living entity who is inquisitive to understand all Vedic principles is also part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and as such is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In all the Vedicmantrasthe wordo\u1e41,calledpra\u1e47ava,is a transcendental sound vibration and is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And because in all the hymns of the fourVedas \u2013 S\u0101ma, Yajur, \u1e5agandAtharva\u2013 thepra\u1e47ava,oro\u1e41-k\u0101ra,is very prominent, it is understood to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

If one wishes to engage in devotional service to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of life \u2013 the transcendental loving service of God \u2013 then one should find out what the Lord desires of him. One who loves K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will give Him whatever He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked. Thus meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If He desired such things as offerings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, \u201cI will accept it.\u201d Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.\n\nHere Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval Lord and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of sacrifices He desires to be offered.

Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature.

In the Seventh Chapter, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature. And so in this instance, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hearing the devotee\u2019s words of love in offering foodstuffs iswhollyidentical with His eating and actually tasting.

And the wordmantavya\u1e25is still more emphatic. If one does not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown, then one is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. The only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service.\n\nIn theN\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha Pur\u0101\u1e47athe following statement is given:\n\nIn theN\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha Pur\u0101\u1e47athe following statement is given:\n\nbhagavati ca har\u0101v ananya-cet\u0101bh\u1e5b\u015ba-malino \u2019pi vir\u0101jate manu\u1e63ya\u1e25na hi \u015ba\u015ba-kalu\u1e63a-cchabi\u1e25 kad\u0101cittimira-par\u0101bhavat\u0101m upaiti candra\u1e25\n\nThe meaning is that even if one fully engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is sometimes found engaged in abominable activities, these activities should be considered to be like the spots that resemble the mark of a rabbit on the moon. Such spots do not become an impediment to the diffusion of moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of saintly character does not make him abominable.\n\nThe meaning is that even if one fully engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is sometimes found engaged in abominable activities, these activities should be considered to be like the spots that resemble the mark of a rabbit on the moon.

Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of saintly character does not make him abominable.\n\nOn the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material connections. Devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against the illusory energy. As long as one is not strong enough to fight the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when one is strong enough, he is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously explained. No one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and think that he is still a devotee. If he does not improve in his character by devotional service, then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee.\n\nOn the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material connections.

His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no actual chance to fall down, because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and happily live in this material world.

Once situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into thebrahma-jyotireffulgence in the spiritual sky. In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which is called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the supreme planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and rests there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in theCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta(Madhya-l\u012bl\u0101,Chapter Nineteen). It is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord.\n\nIn the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into thebrahma-jyotireffulgence in the spiritual sky. In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which is called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the supreme planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and rests there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on.

In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord.\n\nThe\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamis also full of such narrations about the relationship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamis very dear to the devotees, as stated in theBh\u0101gavatamitself (12.13.18).\u015ar\u012bmad-bh\u0101gavata\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47am amala\u1e41 yad vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 priyam.In this narration there is nothing about material activities, economic development, sense gratification or liberation.\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamis the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His devotees is fully described.

So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A common man or even a liberated man who has realized impersonal Brahman or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 may not understand God\u2019s personality.

And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as Bh\u016bte\u015ba, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Deva-deva, the worshipful God of all demigods.

For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

The four-handed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and the two-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The wordstvad anyena na d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-p\u016brvam(verse 47) state that before Arjuna, no one had seen that universal form. Also, they suggest that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the request of Arjuna so that in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.\n\nThe personal forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are described assu-durdar\u015bam, very difficult to see.

If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that is alsok\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma.One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land \u2013 in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land \u2013 can utilize that for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by growing flowers to offer Him. One can sowtulas\u012bplants, becausetulas\u012bleaves are very important and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has recommended this inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.

This leaf especially refers to thetulas\u012b.So one can sowtulas\u012band pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nNo work should be done by any man except in relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is calledk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma.One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work; the result should be done only for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one has to do business for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of the business, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should enjoy the profit of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can do it. This is work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can install the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and arrange for the Deity\u2019s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is allk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma.One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one should accept aspras\u0101damthe remnants of offerings to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowingbrahma-jyotireffulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the wordmad-bhakta\u1e25,he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.\n\nThe wordmat-parama\u1e25refers to one who considers the association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life.

One should disassociate himself from persons who are against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Not only are the atheistic persons against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but so also are those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation.

He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is called pure devotional service.\u0100nuk\u016blyasya sa\u1e45kalpa\u1e25 pr\u0101tik\u016blyasya varjanam(Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa11.676).

Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious in every respect, but that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation.

How is this? A devotee situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows that only devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can relieve a person from all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord who risked their lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but he sacrificed his life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand that he was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa and Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and it is difficult. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one\u2019s neighbor from all material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all forms.

In the Seventh Chapter He spoke of the living entity as being part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommended that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. Then again in the Eighth Chapter it was said that anyone who thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of quitting his body is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, to the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord clearly said that of allyog\u012bs,one who always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within himself is considered the most perfect. So in practically every chapter the conclusion has been that one should be attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for that is the highest spiritual realization.\n\nNevertheless, there are those who are not attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They are so firmly detached that even in the preparation of commentaries toBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101they want to distract other people from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and transfer all devotion to the impersonalbrahma-jyotir. They prefer to meditate on the impersonal form of the Absolute Truth, which is beyond the reach of the senses and is not manifest.\n\nNevertheless, there are those who are not attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

They prefer to meditate on the impersonal form of the Absolute Truth, which is beyond the reach of the senses and is not manifest.\n\nAnd so, factually, there are two classes of transcendentalists. Now Arjuna is trying to settle the question of which process is easier and which of the classes is most perfect. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants to say, \u201cWhat is the use of such a waste of time?\u201d Arjuna experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This important question asked of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the Absolute Truth.\n\nAnd so, factually, there are two classes of transcendentalists.

There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end.

When he offers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a food, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-ized by eating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service cannot understand how this is so, although this is a process recommended in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and in other Vedic literatures.",

For those who are actually not able to follow the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness it is better to cultivate knowledge, because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. In the cultivation of knowledge there are processes which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byasand\u015b\u016bdras,which we shall find in the last chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.But in all cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ the result ofkarmafor some good cause.\n\nAs mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional service: the way of regulative principles and the way of full attachment in love to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may take either the step-by-step process or the direct path. The direct process is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna, because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. It is for others, who are not at this stage; for them the gradual process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and Brahman should be followed. But as far asBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nIn summary, to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the other process is direct.

Such processes are very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person engaged in them. The question of who is better \u2013 one who is engaged in the path of impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2013 was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step-by-step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,is more congenial. One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together, because by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically.\n\nIn this chapter, from verse 2 through the end \u2013 frommayy \u0101ve\u015bya mano ye m\u0101m(\u201cfixing the mind on Me\u201d) throughye tu dharm\u0101m\u1e5btam idam(\u201cthis religion of eternal engagement\u201d) \u2013 the Supreme Lord has explained the processes of transcendental service for approaching Him.

Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step-by-step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,is more congenial. One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together, because by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the\u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101in the matter of Devotional Service.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the\u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101in the matter of Devotional Service.",

One is superior and the other is subordinate.

But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental.\u201d Similarly, in the originalVedas,a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in theKa\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad.There are many great sages who have explained this, and Par\u0101\u015bara is considered principal among them.\n\nThe wordchandobhi\u1e25refers to the various Vedic literatures. TheTaittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad,for example, which is a branch of theYajur Veda,describes nature, the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nThe wordchandobhi\u1e25refers to the various Vedic literatures. TheTaittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad,for example, which is a branch of theYajur Veda,describes nature, the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nAs stated before,k\u1e63etrais the field of activities, and there are two kinds ofk\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a:the individual living entity and the supreme living entity. As stated in theTaittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad(2.5),brahma puccha\u1e41 prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101.There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord\u2019s energy known asanna-maya,dependence upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then, inpr\u0101\u1e47a-maya,after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms or life forms. Inj\u00f1\u0101na-maya,realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of thinking, feeling and willing. Then there is Brahman realization, calledvij\u00f1\u0101na-maya,in which the living entity\u2019s mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is\u0101nanda-maya,realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five stages of Brahman realization, which are calledbrahma puccham.Out of these, the first three \u2013anna-maya, pr\u0101\u1e47a-mayaandj\u00f1\u0101na-maya\u2013 involve the fields of activities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called\u0101nanda-maya.TheVed\u0101nta-s\u016btraalso describes the Supreme by saying,\u0101nanda-mayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t:the Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy. To enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands intovij\u00f1\u0101na-maya, pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya, j\u00f1\u0101na-mayaandanna-maya.In the field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the\u0101nanda-maya.That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the\u0101nanda-maya,then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord as the supreme knower of the field, the living entity as the subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities. One has to search for this truth in theVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra,orBrahma-s\u016btra.\n\nAs stated before,k\u1e63etrais the field of activities, and there are two kinds ofk\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a:the individual living entity and the supreme living entity.

This is very nicely explained in the\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad(3.19) in the verseap\u0101\u1e47i-p\u0101do javano grah\u012bt\u0101.The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated, but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, but He has eyes \u2013 otherwise how could He see? He sees everything \u2013 past, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in the future. This is also confirmed inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101:He knows everything, but no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature.\n\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy, because He is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that His whole embodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form, calledsac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha.He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of all energy. He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all activity. As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, face, hands or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation we can see the Lord\u2019s form. Due to materially contaminated senses, we cannot see His form. Therefore the impersonalists, who are still materially affected, cannot understand the Personality of Godhead.\n\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by His internal potency.

As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature.\n\nThis verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities transmigrate from one body to another.

And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature.\n\nHow he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to association with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore, above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental position. That is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Unless one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science of God from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process, will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedicmantrait is said that as he becomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.\n\nHow he is put into such different bodies is explained here.

Some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually there is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is very important. Lord Caitanya, who preached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps, one will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee. In this verse particularly, the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very appropriate. Although the common man is often not as capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead, back to home.\n\nThis verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern society there is practically no education in spiritual matters.

When one can see this, he attains spiritual vision; thus being freed from differentiations like man, animal, big, low, etc., one becomes purified in his consciousness and able to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in his spiritual identity. How he then sees things will be explained in the next verse.",

Now, in this chapter, the Supreme Personality explains what those modes of nature are, how they act, how they bind and how they give liberation. The knowledge explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be superior to the knowledge given so far in other chapters. By understanding this knowledge, various great sages attained perfection and transferred to the spiritual world. The Lord now explains the same knowledge in a better way. This knowledge is far, far superior to all other processes of knowledge thus far explained, and knowing this many attained perfection. Thus it is expected that one who understands this Fourteenth Chapter will attain perfection.",

Each is very proud of his knowledge, and because they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for working in that way, they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the spiritual world. Repeatedly one may become a philosopher, a scientist or a poet, and repeatedly become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death. But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant.\n\nThe difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others.

Animal life is always miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy,m\u0101y\u0101,the animals do not understand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state. Because of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the Supreme Lord.

If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance.

Br\u0101hma\u1e47asare the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, thebr\u0101hma\u1e47asand the cows, must be given all protection \u2013 that is real advancement of civilization. In modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. It is to be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation. A civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and all nations should take care to provide the easiest process, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, to save humanity from the greatest danger.\n\n\u201cMy Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as,and You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world.\u201d (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a1.19.65) The purport is that special mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as. Br\u0101hma\u1e47asare the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, thebr\u0101hma\u1e47asand the cows, must be given all protection \u2013 that is real advancement of civilization. In modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. It is to be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation. A civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance.

The Sanskrit worddeh\u012bmeans \u201cembodied.\u201d Although one is within this material body, by his advancement in spiritual knowledge he can be free from the influence of the modes of nature. He can enjoy the happiness of spiritual life even in this body because, after leaving this body, he is certainly going to the spiritual sky. But even in this body he can enjoy spiritual happiness.

As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a activities.

Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there would be no meaning tobhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature,brahmaiva san brahm\u0101py eti.

Therefore, both Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord.

This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this stage the Brahman-realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Due to the association of these three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By engagement in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional service, beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering \u2013 the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service \u2013 should be practiced in the association of devotees. Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one\u2019s material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the Lord\u2019s transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees.

One who can thus situate himself in thebrahma-jyotiror the different varieties of the Brahman conception is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourteenth Chapter of the\u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101in the matter of the Three Modes of Material Nature.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourteenth Chapter of the\u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101in the matter of the Three Modes of Material Nature.",

The first qualification is that one should not be deluded by pride. Because the conditioned soul is puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is very difficult for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering the land, this earth, to belong to human society, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social and national affections. These faulty associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And when one has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nThe surrendering process is described here very nicely.

One should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering the land, this earth, to belong to human society, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social and national affections. These faulty associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And when one has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

There are different universes and solar systems, and there are different suns, moons and planets also, but in each universe there is only one sun. As stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(10.21), the moon is one of the stars (nak\u1e63atr\u0101\u1e47\u0101m aha\u1e41 \u015ba\u015b\u012b). Sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun, the activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their foodstuff, they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done with the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to the living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then one\u2019s K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will begin. By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is so pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without His mercy there cannot be sun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there cannot be fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can live. These are some thoughts to provoke K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the conditioned soul.\n\nFrom this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the whole solar system. There are different universes and solar systems, and there are different suns, moons and planets also, but in each universe there is only one sun. As stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(10.21), the moon is one of the stars (nak\u1e63atr\u0101\u1e47\u0101m aha\u1e41 \u015ba\u015b\u012b). Sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun, the activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their foodstuff, they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done with the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to the living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then one\u2019s K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will begin.

Because a living entity individually needs to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

By understanding Vedic literature one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by performing the different processes one can approach Him, and at the end one can attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse the purpose of theVedas,the understanding of theVedas,and the goal of theVedasare clearly defined.\n\nAnta\u1e25-pravi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 \u015b\u0101st\u0101 jan\u0101n\u0101m.The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord.

So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand theVedasfrom Him. If one is serious about understanding the Vedic knowledge, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives the required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vedic literature confirms this:yo \u2019sau sarvair vedair g\u012byate.In all Vedic literature, beginning from the fourVedas, Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btraand theUpani\u1e63adsandPur\u0101\u1e47as,the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performance of Vedic rituals, discussion of the Vedic philosophy and worship of the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. Therefore the purpose of theVedasis to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. TheVedasgive us direction by which to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the process of realizing Him. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra(1.1.4) confirms this in the following words:tat tu samanvay\u0101t.One can attain perfection in three stages. By understanding Vedic literature one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by performing the different processes one can approach Him, and at the end one can attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse the purpose of theVedas,the understanding of theVedas,and the goal of theVedasare clearly defined.",

The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,this fact is being stressed at every step.

Those who are born with divine qualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and by the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of authoritative scripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not follow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric. There is no other criterion but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in Vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the Praj\u0101pati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and the other does not.\n\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities, is now describing the demoniac way.

She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is proper social behavior according to theManu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101.But modern education has artificially devised a puffed-up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society. The social condition of women is thus not very good now, although those who are married are in a better condition than those who are proclaiming their so-called freedom. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable.\n\nAs for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as theManu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101,which is the law of the human race.

This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are some of the defects of human society which lead to the demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one\u2019s life becomes successful.\n\nIn human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns.

One\u2019s faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. One\u2019s strong faith is supposed to be productive of works of material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one\u2019s faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one\u2019s faith is established. It should be understood that if one\u2019s heart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted we find different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship.\n\nThe word\u015braddh\u0101,or \u201cfaith,\u201d is very significant in this verse.\u015araddh\u0101,or faith, originally comes out of the mode of goodness.

But in material conditional life, no works are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one\u2019s faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one\u2019s faith is established. It should be understood that if one\u2019s heart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted we find different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship.",

We recall that during the Second World War a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God.

Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness. Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts.

Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end.

By such discussions, one may derive the highest benefit and elevate human society. There is a limitless stock of Vedic literature, and one should study this. This is called penance of speech.",

Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one can obtain success without following this principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is the way to make everything successful.\n\nIn the conditional state, people are attracted to worshiping demigods, ghosts, or Yak\u1e63as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One should therefore take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly. That is the message of this Seventeenth Chapter.\n\nIn the conditional state, people are attracted to worshiping demigods, ghosts, or Yak\u1e63as like Kuvera.

In all living entities, one spirit soul is there, although they have different bodies in terms of their previous work. As described in the Seventh Chapter, the manifestation of the living force in every body is due to the superior nature of the Supreme Lord. Thus to see that one superior nature, that living force, in every body is to see in the mode of goodness. That living energy is imperishable, although the bodies are perishable. Differences are perceived in terms of the body; because there are many forms of material existence in conditional life, the living force appears to be divided. Such impersonal knowledge is an aspect of self-realization.",

No one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the order of the spiritual master, who is the representative of God. One should act unhesitatingly to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2013 that will keep one safe under all circumstances.",

He is meant for self-discipline. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the Supreme Lord he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living entity\u2019s constitutional position is to be a servitor; he has to serve either the illusorym\u0101y\u0101or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare ofm\u0101y\u0101to trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order.\n\nThe constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord.

He is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies.

The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse:man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakta\u1e25.One must become a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). The instructions ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of theG\u012bt\u0101is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\nFromBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are confidential, meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more confidential. And surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the most confidential instruction. That is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\nFromBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the highest perfection.

The Absolute Truth is realized in three features \u2013 impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.\n\nAnother feature ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth \u2013 impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and any other transcendental conception \u2013 exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya\u2019s philosophy is that of \u201cinconceivable oneness and difference.\u201d This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.\n\nInBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities.

He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may be compared to the sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the marginal energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they have a tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.\n\nThe living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit.
