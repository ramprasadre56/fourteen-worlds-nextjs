<br/>
															When God Spoke — and Still Speaks<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>
																By Charu Bali<br/>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															During Gita Jayanti each year, I find myself drawn back to
															that sacred moment on the battlefield of Kurukshetra — the
															moment when time stood still, and the Supreme Lord chose to
															speak.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															It was not in a temple, nor in the serenity of a forest
															hermitage, but amidst the dust, the clanging of weapons, and
															the trembling heart of a warrior. In that chaos, Krishna’s
															voice emerged — calm, compassionate, and eternal.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Sometimes I wonder — why did the Lord choose a battlefield
															to reveal the most peaceful and profound message of the
															ages? Perhaps because every human heart is a Kurukshetra.
															Each of us stands, like Arjuna, facing our own wars —
															between duty and desire, conviction and confusion, surrender
															and control.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															When I open Bhagavad-gitaand read Arjuna’s trembling words —
															<em>“Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all
																composure because of weakness”</em>
															(Bg. 2.7) — I see not a distant hero, but myself. Srila
															Prabhupada writes that Arjuna’s hesitation was not weakness,
															but the beginning of wisdom — the humility to admit, “I do
															not know; I must hear from Krishna.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															That is where the Gita begins. Not with pride, but with
															surrender. Not with answers, but with a prayer to be
															guided.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Kurukshetra was not just a field of war—it was the
															battlefield of the heart. When Arjuna, the mightiest of
															warriors, saw his loved ones standing before him, his
															resolve melted. His bow slipped from his hand, his limbs
															trembled, and he sank into despair. “Govinda, I shall not
															fight,” he said (Gita 1.47).<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															In that moment, Arjuna became every one of us. Each of us
															faces our own Kurukshetra — the inner conflict between duty
															and desire, reason and emotion, self-interest and
															selflessness. It appears in our offices, where ambition
															wrestles with integrity. It surfaces in our families, where
															love demands sacrifice. It arises within, when we struggle
															between what we want and what we ought to do.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The Gita does not tell us to run away from these
															battlefields; it teaches us how to stand and fight — with
															consciousness. Krishna’s instruction to Arjuna, “Fight for
															the sake of fighting,without considering happiness or
															distress, loss or gain, victory or defeat” (Gita 2.38), is
															not a call to violence but to detachment — to act without
															selfish motive and to let the Lord be the doer.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Srila Prabhupada explains that true spirituality is not
															about changing our work but changing our consciousness while
															we work. The battlefield may remain, but our heart becomes
															sanctified when we act as Krishna’s instrument.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															When Arjuna, overwhelmed, finally turned to Krishna and
															said, “Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all
															composure because of weakness. Please instruct me” (Gita
															2.7), the real battle began — not with weapons, but with
															surrender. Srila Prabhupada writes, “When a man is confused
															in his duty, he should not act blindly but should approach a
															spiritual master for guidance.” That single moment of
															surrender transformed Arjuna’s despair into the doorway to
															divine wisdom. And it can do the same for us.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															When I first grasped this, the Gita stopped being a book and
															became a mirror. It began to show me my attachments, my
															fears, and the smallness of my surrender. It reminded me
															that Krishna is not asking for perfection — only for
															participation. He asks that we act for Him, think of Him,
															and remember Him — and then He promises to take care of the
															rest.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The words of the <em>Bhagavad-gita</em>
															are not relics preserved in scripture; they are living
															instructions, spoken by the eternal Lord for a world that is
															still restless and searching. Though the dialogue took place
															five thousand years ago, its sound continues to echo through
															the ages — the compassionate call of Krishna to every
															bewildered soul.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															In this age of anxiety and endless distraction, His
															assurance still resounds: “For one who has conquered the
															mind, the mind is the best friend; for one who has failed to
															do so, the mind will remain the greatest enemy.” (Gita 6.6)
															When life feels like a race between gain and loss, success
															and failure, He gently reminds us: “You have a right to
															perform your prescribed duty, but not to the fruits
															thereof.” (Gita 2.47) And to a humanity divided by
															boundaries of nation, creed, and class, He reveals the truth
															that unites us all: “I am the seed-giving father of all
															living entities.” (Gita 14.4)<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The <em>Gita</em>
															speaks not to one category of people, but to every sincere
															heart — to kings and clerks, monks and mothers, scientists
															and students — to anyone who has ever felt lost in the noise
															of life and longed for a steady voice of guidance. Srila
															Prabhupada writes in his introduction to
															<em>Bhagavad-gita</em>
															: “The Gita is meant for delivering mankind from the
															nescience of material existence. It teaches us to act for
															Krishna and thus become free from all reactions.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The world may change — empires may rise and fall, languages
															may fade, technologies may advance — but Krishna’s voice
															remains the same. It is the voice beyond time, calling each
															of us to awaken, to remember, and to return to our eternal
															relationship with Him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Five thousand years have passed since that conversation, yet
															every time I open the Gita, Krishna speaks again. His words
															are not locked in time; they are alive. Srila Prabhupada
															once said, “We do not read the Bhagavad-gita; we hear it
															directly from Krishna.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															That is the miracle of the Gita — it is not philosophy on
															paper, but a divine dialogue that continues through
															<em>parampara.</em>
															Through Srila Prabhupada, the same voice that spoke to
															Arjuna now speaks to us.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															When Srila Prabhupada boarded the Jaladuta in 1965 with a
															few boxes of <em>Bhagavad-gita,</em>
															he was carrying the eternal sound of Kurukshetra across the
															oceans. The world had heard many translations before, but
															none that revealed Krishna as <em>the Supreme Person</em>
															, the loving friend of all beings.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Through his purports, Krishna’s words regained their
															original sweetness and authority. The Gita was no longer a
															text to be analyzed; it became a relationship to be lived.
															Srila Prabhupada often said, “The Bhagavad-gita is the
															summary of the whole Vedic knowledge.” But more than that —
															it is Krishna’s invitation to come home.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Every December, as Gita Jayanti coincides with the Book
															Distribution Marathon in ISKCON, I’m reminded that
															Kurukshetra is not only a battlefield of surrender — it’s
															also a battlefield of compassion. When devotees go out to
															share the Gita, they are continuing Arjuna’s service. Each
															book handed out is another chariot waiting to be drawn by
															Krishna. Each seeker who opens it becomes another Arjuna,
															waiting to be guided.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															I once heard a senior devotee say, “The sound of sankirtan
															is Krishna speaking again through His devotees.” How true
															that is! When we distribute Prabhupada’s books, we are not
															merely spreading information — we are offering Krishna’s
															voice to a world that has forgotten how to listen.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Srila Prabhupada once told his disciples, “Distribute books
															and your life will be perfect.” That statement is not about
															numbers or achievements — it’s about participation in
															Krishna’s compassion. It’s about becoming an instrument.
															When we serve in that mood, the battlefield of Kurukshetra
															merges with the battlefield of <em>sankirtana —</em>
															both are arenas where the Lord’s plan unfolds through the
															surrender of His devotee.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The <em>Bhagavad-gita</em>
															is often called the <em>Gitopanishad</em>
															— the essence of all Vedic wisdom. Within its seven hundred
															verses, Krishna reveals the heart of the
															<em>Upanishads,</em>
															the conclusion of the <em>Vedanta,</em>
															and the mercy of the <em>Puranas —</em>
															all distilled into one eternal conversation between the Lord
															and His devotee.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															In Chapter 15, verse 15, Krishna declares: “By all the
															Vedas, I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler of
															<em>Vedanta,</em>
															and I am the knower of the Vedas.” Srila Prabhupada explains
															with such simplicity and grace: “The purpose of studying the
															Vedas is to understand Krishna. One who is engaged in
															devotional service has already understood everything.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Every path — <em>karma, jnana, </em>
															or<em>dhyana —</em>
															eventually leads to this single truth: that all knowledge,
															all austerity, all endeavor finds its fulfillment in loving
															surrender to the Supreme. Step by step, Krishna leads the
															soul through duty, knowledge, and meditation until He
															finally reveals the secret of all secrets: “Abandon all
															varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall
															deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.” (Gita
															18.66) This verse stands like the golden sun rising over the
															horizon of all scriptures. It is not merely a command; it is
															a promise — a tender assurance from the Lord that surrender
															is not defeat, but the beginning of true freedom.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Some people think the Gita is an ancient scripture meant for
															seers or scholars, but the more I live with it, the more I
															see — it’s meant for me, for all of us.Krishna’s words are
															timeless because the soul’s struggle never changes. We may
															now hold smartphones instead of bows, but the confusions of
															the heart remain the same.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															“To those who are constantly devoted to serving Me with
															love, I give the understanding by which they can come to
															Me.” (Gita 10.10) Every time I read this verse, I feel
															Krishna’s promise whispering softly — “Just remember Me, and
															I will guide you.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															In moments of doubt, the Gita becomes my anchor. In times of
															pride, it becomes my mirror. And in times of weakness, it
															becomes my shelter. It teaches me that Krishna does not love
															me because I am strong; He loves me even when I am
															bewildered, just as He loved Arjuna before the battle
															began.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Gita Jayanti is not just a festival; it is an invitation. It
															calls every soul to rediscover the divine dialogue between
															God and His devotee.<br/>

<br/>
															The battlefield may look different today — crowded offices,
															silent hospital rooms, busy highways—but the war remains the
															same: the struggle between illusion and remembrance, between
															selfishness and surrender.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Kurukshetra is not far away. It is within us. And victory
															does not come when we defeat others, but when we allow
															Krishna to conquer our heart. Srila Prabhupada concludes in
															his preface: “If one reads <em>Bhagavad-gita</em>
															very sincerely and with all seriousness, then by the grace
															of the Lord, the reaction of knowledge will act upon him.
															There will be enlightenment, and Krishna will reveal
															Himself.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															So this Gita Jayanti, let us do just that. Let us open the
															Gita once more, not as readers but as seekers. Let us hear
															Krishna again. Let us live by His words. Let us share them
															with others.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															For the <em>Bhagavad-gita</em>
															is not merely a scripture — it is the Lord’s song of love.
															And its call still resounds — from Kurukshetra to every
															heart willing to listen.<br/>
