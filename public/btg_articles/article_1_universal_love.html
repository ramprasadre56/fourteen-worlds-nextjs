<p>
<br/>
															I AM THE ORIGIN of everything.” “Everything” includes the
															universe. Whatever you can imagine, that comes within the
															category of everything. So if Krishna is the source of
															everything, if you love Krishna then you love the universe.
															Actually that is so. If you love your father, then you love
															your brother. If you love your country, then you love your
															countrymen.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															I am from India. So I am in a foreign country. If I see a
															gentleman from India, naturally I ask, “Oh, you come from
															India? Which part of India are you from?” Why the attraction
															for that person? I love him because I love India and he
															happens to be Indian.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Love begins from the origin. If you love your body, then you
															love your finger. If you are care less of your body, your
															health, then you don’t care for your finger.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Therefore <em>Bhagavad-gita </em>
															(10.8) says, <em>iti matva bhajante mam. </em>
															When one has understood the fact very nicely,
															scientifically, that God is the origin of all emanations,
															then by loving God he loves everything in the universe. If
															you think, “God is something manufactured by my
															imagination,” then you cannot love the universe or God. You
															have to understand the position of God. In your Bible it is
															said, “God said, ‘Let there be creation,’ so there was
															creation.” Creation is the universe. God created this
															universe. If you love God, then you love this universe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															That is done automatically. If I say, “I love my body” –
															everyone loves his body – that does not mean I do not love
															my finger.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>The Transformed Hunter</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															There is a nice example of how a God-conscious person loves
															everything. In Sanskrit a hunter is called <em>vyadha</em>
															. A <em>vyadha </em>
															was hunting in the forest and half-killing animals, such as
															boars, deer, and many others. The sage Narada was passing
															along the road, and he saw the suffering animals. “These
															half-dead animals are flapping. Who has harmed them in that
															way? Why not fully kill them?”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															He went to the <em>vyadha </em>
															and asked, “Why are you doing this business? Better to kill
															them so that they may not suffer. What you are doing is a
															great sinful act.”<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
															The hunter replied, “Oh, I do not know what is sinful or
															pious. My father has taught me this business. So I am doing
															this.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Narada explained to him, “It is not a very good business.
															You had better do another business for your livelihood.
															Simply half-killing – better to kill them. But that is also
															not very good.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															“Then I am committing sins?”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															“Yes, you are committing sins.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															“Then if I give up this business, how shall I eat, how shall
															I earn my living?”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															“All right,” Narada said, “I shall give you your necessities
															of life. I shall supply you. Give up this business.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															arada initiated the hunter into spiritual life, and the
															hunter went to a sacred place to execute spiritual
															practices.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															When villagers understood that a <em>vyadha</em>
															, a hunter, had become a great saint, they brought him
															offerings of rice, flowers, fruits, and so on. And he
															executed his devotional service according to Narada’s
															instructions.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															After some time, Narada wanted to show that devotee to his
															friend Parvata Muni. As they were arriving, the former
															hunter went forward to receive them. While going, he was
															very careful that even an ant may not be killed on the path.
															So he was jumping. Whenever there was an ant, he was
															jumping.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Narada inquired, “While you were coming here, why were you
															jumping?”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															“Sir, there were so many ants. How can I kill an ant?”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Just see. The same man who without any kindness was
															half-killing so many animals has become kind even to the
															ants.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															This is universal love. As soon as you become Krishna
															conscious, as soon as you become God conscious, then your
															real, ideal, universal consciousness develops. Otherwise it
															is all simply word jugglery. There are so many doctrines of
															universal love, universal friendship, fraternity, but people
															are fighting and killing because there is no God
															consciousness. If you are after universal love, then how can
															you maintain regular slaughterhouses? How can you think that
															an American gentleman or lady is your countryman and not a
															cow, and not a goat, not a serpent? Where is your universal
															idea?<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Unless there is development of God consciousness, universal
															ideas are nonsense. They are all false, a jugglery of
															words.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The first business is to understand your identity, God’s
															identity, and your relationship with God, and to reform your
															actions in line with that understanding. Then there can be
															universal brotherhood. Otherwise it is simply a jugglery of
															words.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Love Everyone</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															If you are thinking in a universal way, how can you give
															protection to a human being born in America and send a cow
															to the slaughterhouse? What is your reason?<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Guest: </strong>
															This would be a personal love.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Prabhupada: </strong>
															Universal means all. You have to love everyone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Guest: </strong>
															If I don’t love the cow as equally as I love a child, then
															it is a personal love because I’m defining
															qualifications.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Prabhupada: </strong>
															But how can you avoid this “personal”?<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Guest: </strong>
															Because to love the child only, I have to exclude other
															things, meaning the cow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Prabhupada: </strong>
															But when you love, how can you avoid a person? What do you
															mean by love? In the universe there are so many men,
															animals, plants, beasts, and birds, and so many things. So
															we have to love everyone. That is universal. You cannot
															discriminate, “Oh, this is not universal, and this is
															universal.” Universal means all-inclusive. You have to love
															everyone. That is universal.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Guest: </strong>
															If I don’t do that, then I have a love with limitations, and
															this is false.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Prabhupada: </strong>
															No. Not limitation. The point is, if you love the root, then
															you love everything. If you pour water on the root of the
															tree, then the branches, the flowers, the leaves, the
															fruits, and everything is nourished. You have to know the
															technique – how to love the whole. If somebody is loving the
															tree by putting water on every leaf, every branch, every
															flower, then he is spoiling his time. An intelligent man
															pours one bucketful of water on the root. Oh, it is
															distributed. If without knowledge of the root you want to
															love the branches, that is foolishness. You love your body.
															Why do you supply your food to the stomach? Why not to the
															eyes, to the ears, to the nose? Why not individually to
															every finger, every hand, every part, every hair? No. As
															soon as you put the foodstuff into the stomach, the energy
															is at once distributed everywhere. Similarly, universal love
															means to love God.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															People do not know the technique. This man, this hunter,
															loved God, and he became a lover of the ant automatically.
															There was no need of separate education. “Love this ant,
															love this cow, love this tree, love this country, love this
															man, love the white man, the black man, this man . . .” No.
															As soon as you love God, and you understand what God is,
															then you love everything.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															In the <em>Bhagavad-gita </em>
															(14.4) it is said,<br/>
</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>
<em>sarva-yonishu kaunteya</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>murtayah sambhavanti yah</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>tasam brahma mahad yonir</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>aham bija-pradah pita</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br/>
															“It should be understood that all species of life, O son of
															Kunti, are made possible by birth in this material nature,
															and that I am the seed-giving father.” People are accepting
															<em>Bhagavad-gita </em>
															as something Indian or Hindu, but actually it is not. It is
															universal. Krishna says that there are many forms of living
															entities. There are 8,400,000 different types of bodies.
															“And all of them are My sons.” So if you love Krishna, then
															you love the white man, you love the American, you love the
															European, you love the Indian, you love the cow, you love
															the dog, you love the serpent — everything.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															You have to know the techniques. Simply by theoretical
															knowledge you cannot make any improvement. And these are
															practical examples. Because there is no love for God at the
															present moment, all this nonsense universal love,
															fraternity, is going to hell. Therefore we are interested in
															this Krishna consciousness movement. You have to change your
															consciousness, make it full with Krishna, or God. Then
															everything will be all right.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Thank you.<br/>
