                                                            English singer songwriter Ed Sheeran’s latest track
                                                            Sapphire, featuring Arijit Singh, has exploded among Indian
                                                            listeners. With over 90 million views on YouTube, the song
                                                            is everywhere, from restaurants and bars to social media and
                                                            ringtones. At the moment, it’s as popular as popular culture
                                                            can get.<br/>

                                                            With songs like this one, which have an energetic vibe and
                                                            upbeat mood, the lyrics tend to take a backseat in the
                                                            listening experience. But a closer look at the words reveals
                                                            what is true of most popular culture the world over — in the
                                                            way that artists speak about their beloved, it’s clear that
                                                            they’ve placed that person where Krishna should be.<br/>

                                                            Consider this verse from the song:<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            “Look what we found, Karma reached out<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            Into our hearts and pulled us to our feet now<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            You know, the truth is we could disappear<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            Anywhere, as long as I got you there<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            When the sun dies, till the day shines<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            ‘Cause when I’m with you, there’s not enough time”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            In these lines, for instance, karma has brought two people
                                                            together. And Sheeran is singing about how the two of them
                                                            could disappear together because all he needs is this
                                                            person. They could be away together for all of eternity,
                                                            till the day is bright but also till the sun disappears,
                                                            because no amount of time feels enough when he’s with the
                                                            object of his affection.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            We’re all souls. And each one of us has a longing to return
                                                            to Krishna, and to serve Him for eternity. But over millions
                                                            of years, our consciousness has been covered by temptation
                                                            and become materially contaminated. So that longing, to
                                                            spend eternity with one being, is displaced. Instead of
                                                            placing Krishna in the centre of our lives, we find someone
                                                            who is probably attractive in one way or the other, and we
                                                            place them at the centre of our existence. We make it all
                                                            about them. We convince ourselves that true happiness lies
                                                            in being with this person. And artists very beautifully
                                                            express this misplaced longing in their own unique ways.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            But even if we do connect with that person, we experience
                                                            only temporary happiness. And sooner or later, that longing
                                                            will return. That hole, that emptiness, will continue to
                                                            live in our chest. We can try to fill it with another
                                                            person, with art, with food, intoxications. But from the
                                                            soul’s eternal perspective, these are all temporary matters.
                                                            And still that longing will return. Till we don’t find
                                                            Krishna, that longing will stay. Sometimes, even after we’ve
                                                            learnt about Krishna, that longing comes back, because we
                                                            aren’t putting in the effort to connect with Him through
                                                            chanting and other activities prescribed by Prabhupada.<br/>

                                                            But artists like Sheeran, who perhaps don’t know that much
                                                            about the soul or Krishna but are in touch with the longing,
                                                            will continue to create art like this, art that focuses on
                                                            the body as the self and their lover as the ultimate. And we
                                                            continue to listen, to sing and dance along, subconsciously
                                                            internalising ideas that relate to the self as the body and
                                                            not the soul.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            The moment we understand that we’re the soul, and that
                                                            Krishna is the ultimate goal, the ultimate friend, family,
                                                            partner, we’ll start to lose our taste for materially
                                                            situated art. It’s not that art is a bad thing or something
                                                            to be shunned, but as one creates and consumes art, it’s
                                                            prudent to keep in mind that most of it is not spiritually
                                                            aware, and to ask ourselves what we can do about that.<br/>
