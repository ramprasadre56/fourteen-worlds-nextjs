            <em>Despite our lack of spiritual qualifications, we can transcend material existence by hearing Lord
                Krishna's teachings.</em>

            "Again there are those who, although not conversant in spiritual knowledge, begin to worship the Supreme
            Person upon hearing about Him from others. Because of their tendency to hear from authorities, they also
            transcend the path of birth and death."
            <br />– Bhagavad-gita 13.26.
        </p>

        <p>
            GENERALLY PEOPLE do not know the value of spiritual knowledge. They have been called mudha – "foolish" – and
            dushkritina. Dushkritina means always engaged in sinful activities. If you do not have Krishna
            consciousness, then your eating or sleeping or walking, whatever you are doing, is sinful. All of it is
            sinful. You do not know how you are becoming responsible for killing so many ants while you are walking. We
            have seen that so many ants are loitering on the street, and you are killing them by walking. That means you
            are responsible. You cannot kill even a single ant without repercussion. Therefore, unless you come to
            Krishna consciousness, whatever you are doing in your daily life is sinful. And you are becoming implicated.
        </p>

        <p>
            This world is so made that at every step you are creating some dangerous situation. For example, Lord
            Krishna says, bhunjate te tv agham papa ye pachanty atmakaranat (Gita 3.13). This means that generally
            people cook for themselves nice palatable foodstuffs to eat and enjoy. But they do not know that they are
            eating sin.

        <h3>The Body as a Machine</h3>

        <p>
            The body is a machine. This body has been described as yantra, a machine. It is just like a machine. And we
            can perceive that. As soon as some part of the machine of the body is slackened, or not in order, the body
            is in a diseased condition. You cannot work.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Insecure Position</h3>

        <p>
            We should not be very much satisfied or rest assured that "I am in a very secure position because I am
            American" or "I am this, I am that." You are not in a secure position. At any moment this car, this body,
            will stop functioning and you will have to change. And you do not know what kind of change it will be. It
            may be a very nice change, or it may be a very bad change. So therefore it is a very dangerous position. It
            is very dangerous. You do not know what will happen, but you have to know. And you can know that – if you
            follow the scriptural injunctions in the Bhagavad-gita.
        </p>

        <p>
            You do not know what kind of body you are going to get next life, but you can know from Bhagavad-gita. You
            cannot speculate, but you can know from Bhagavad-gita.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Bhagavad-gita (14.18) says:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
            <p><em>urdhvam gacchanti sattva-stha madhye tishthanti rajasah</em></p>
            <p><em>jaghanya-guna-vritti-stha adho gacchanti tamasah</em></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            "Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of
            passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the abominable mode of ignorance go down to the hellish
            worlds." Urdhvam gacchanti sattvasthah: brahmanas, who are in the mode of goodness, will be promoted to the
            higher planetary system. Madhye tishthanti rajasah: those who are passionate will remain within this middle
            portion of the material world. And adho gacchanti tamasah: those in the mode of ignorance will go down. That
            means they'll have to accept the body of an animal, or lower than that, or in the lower planetary system.

            Everything about the different destinations of the soul after death is explained in the Bhagavad-gita.
