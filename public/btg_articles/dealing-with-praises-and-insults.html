                                                            Most of us will wonder, “What is the big deal in dealing
                                                            with praises?” The more we get, the better. But, yes,
                                                            insults are a big problem. “Who in this world would like to
                                                            get insulted?”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            But the crux of the matter is not so simple. Lord Krishna in
                                                            the Bhagavad-gita (2.14), tells Arjuna, “O son of Kunti, the
                                                            non-permanent appearance of happiness and distress, and
                                                            their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance
                                                            and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise
                                                            from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must
                                                            learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            We meet different people in this world. Some are rude, some
                                                            gentle, some compassionate, some ruthless, some friendly and
                                                            some reserved. Everyone behaves as per their nature.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            When a person praises us, it is more about the nature of
                                                            that person who sees good in all; rather than, our own
                                                            achievements. Similarly, when a person criticizes us, it
                                                            speaks more of the person’s nature to find faults with
                                                            others, rather than our own faults.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            Even if we do good, there will always be someone who will
                                                            point a finger at us. So, instead of sitting and brooding
                                                            about their behaviour, Lord Krishna is telling Arjuna that
                                                            you just tolerate them and don’t get upset.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            The problem with us is that we keep thinking and brooding
                                                            about such incidents, creating so much impressions on the
                                                            mind, that we soon go crazy with the negative emotions
                                                            gripping us. It leads to a lot of health problems and
                                                            destroys our peace of mind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            The person who struck us with the arrow of his harsh words
                                                            merrily moves around, leaving us behind like wounded
                                                            soldiers. So, who suffers in the end? It is we, who gave the
                                                            remote control of our happiness to someone else. So, why
                                                            give the remote control of our happiness to someone else? It
                                                            should always be in our hands.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            We should let go of these incidents from our minds. The more
                                                            we discuss, the stronger the feelings become. That is why
                                                            Lord Krishna is telling Arjuna to tolerate such events, for
                                                            they will come whether we like them or not. The more we
                                                            tolerate them, the stronger we become mentally.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            The underlying problem in all this is our attachment. We are
                                                            attached to praises. With the social media taking centre
                                                            stage in our lives, we all have become addicted to the
                                                            “like” imbued in the “thumbs up” symbol. The more the likes,
                                                            the more elated we feel. But the underlying problem is that
                                                            our mind gets attached to these likes, and when it stops
                                                            coming, we feel unwanted and morose.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            This often is the case with the celebrities. To keep
                                                            themselves young and beautiful and in public eye to receive
                                                            praises, they run after Botox, plastic surgery and what not.
                                                            But nature has its own way. The day these artificial means
                                                            fail to have an effect, and they glide down in public
                                                            opinion, then their mind goes berserk and they fall into
                                                            depression. Lord Krishna is therefore telling Arjuna to
                                                            tolerate the downpour of praises along with the brickbats of
                                                            criticism.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            If we become too elated with praises, then, as the saying
                                                            goes, “The higher we climb, the steeper we fall,” the next
                                                            criticism that comes our way, will smack us so hard, that,
                                                            it will leave us submerged in a pool of mental misery.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            Lord Krishna is thus advising us to keep our balance in
                                                            praise as well as criticism, neither be too elated when
                                                            praised nor be sad when criticized, because after all they
                                                            depend on the perception of the other person.<br/>
