                                                            Recently, during my travels to America, a devotee-doctor in
                                                            Washington, D.C., suggested that I consult a polio
                                                            specialist to evaluate the long-term effects I might
                                                            experience as I age and to prepare for them. However,
                                                            because polio is now an almost extinct disease and the
                                                            number of specialists treating it is vanishingly few, the
                                                            booking didn’t work out at that time. Nonetheless, the
                                                            doctor recommended that I read a book about living with
                                                            polio in the second half of life.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            As I flipped through the book, reading the first-person
                                                            testimonies of polio patients as well as doctors who treat
                                                            them, I felt a strong yet strange sense of disidentification
                                                            with what I read. As I tried to understand that feeling, it
                                                            struck me that I didn’t think of myself as a polio patient.
                                                            More importantly, I didn’t <em>want </em>
                                                            to think of myself that way. Most importantly, I realized
                                                            that I didn’t <em>need </em>
                                                            to think of myself that way—and this was the result of
                                                            finding shelter and light in the wisdom of the
                                                            Bhagavad-gita.<br/>

<strong>Crippled physically, directed
                                                                intellectually</strong>

                                                            To explore my relationship with polio, I went down memory
                                                            lane, focusing on defining incidents in my life. I got polio
                                                            in 1978 when I was about one year old. I was staying in a
                                                            small town named Chandrapur in Maharashtra, India, where my
                                                            mother dutifully took me to a nearby clinic to get the polio
                                                            vaccine. Unfortunately, because it was a small town, the
                                                            power supply was irregular. The previous night there had
                                                            been a power outage in the area where the clinic was
                                                            located. The fridge in which the vaccine had been kept had
                                                            heated up, causing the germs in the vaccine to multiply.<br/>

                                                            Neither the attendant nor the physician noticed this. When I
                                                            was given that vaccine, instead of preventing polio, it
                                                            ended up causing polio. I was just learning to take my first
                                                            steps, and a few hours after receiving that injection, I
                                                            fell down suddenly and could never walk normally
                                                            thereafter.<br/>

<br/>
                                                            I don’t remember any of this, but my first memory is from
                                                            when I was about two and a half or three. I was crawling
                                                            around in the room where my mother was talking with a
                                                            distant relative who had come to visit us. That aunt
                                                            consoled my mother, saying, “It’s so sad your son got
                                                            polio.” I remember my mother’s voice—calm, clear, and
                                                            confident—as she replied, “Whatever he lacks physically, God
                                                            will provide him intellectually.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            I don’t know why she said that. Whether she had observed
                                                            some intellectual precociousness in me, or whether it was
                                                            just her hope, her prayer, or her blessing—I can’t say.
                                                            Still, the steadiness in her voice calmed my restless mind.
                                                            Her words stayed with me: not the God part, but the
                                                            intellectual part. I never asked my mother about it because
                                                            I forgot the incident consciously, though it impacted me
                                                            subconsciously. And when I was 15, she passed away due to
                                                            blood cancer.<br/>

<br/>
                                                            Nonetheless, as I grew up, I did notice that I could read
                                                            rapidly, remember it easily, articulate it clearly, and
                                                            analyze it deeply. Essentially, I did have intellectual
                                                            ability that seemed special.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            While my mother respected the Bhagavad-gita and encouraged
                                                            me to participate in Gita shloka recitation contests, she
                                                            never specifically said that the values she gave me were
                                                            from the Gita. Almost two decades later, when I was
                                                            introduced to the Gita and read in 18.35 about
                                                            self-destructive thought patterns and emotional
                                                            loops—described as results of the mode of ignorance, tamas—I
                                                            realized that my mother’s upbringing and her words had
                                                            helped me move toward the mode of goodness. In that mode, I
                                                            had gained significant clarity about what my strengths were.
                                                            And such clarity, as Gita 14.11 declares, is a hallmark of
                                                            goodness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            My father also encouraged me to develop myself
                                                            intellectually, bringing me many books from a library next
                                                            to his office. The more I identified with my intellectual
                                                            side, the less I felt constrained by my physical side, and
                                                            the less reason I had to identify with my physical side at
                                                            all.<br/>

<p>
<br/>
<strong>Fairly unfair</strong>

                                                            Another incident that shaped me significantly occurred
                                                            during my childhood. There were some kids in our
                                                            neighborhood who would tease me about my disability, calling
                                                            me <br/>
                                                            “cripple.” One boy, in particular, was the leader of this
                                                            mockery. He was an athletic genius, embodying everything I
                                                            lacked physically. His name-calling annoyed me more than it
                                                            hurt me, primarily because I didn’t care much about my
                                                            physical condition. I would have been far more angered if
                                                            someone had called me “stupid.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            One day, my mother told me that this boy’s mother had
                                                            approached her with a request. Her son was struggling in
                                                            school, especially with mathematics, and since I was good at
                                                            the subject, she wanted me to help him. As my mother
                                                            completed her sentence, my head started shaking vigorously.
                                                            “I am not going to help him,” I declared. My mother
                                                            persisted, “They are our neighbors, and he is your friend.”
                                                            I shook my head even more firmly. “He is not my friend,” I
                                                            retorted emphatically. But because my mother was insistent,
                                                            I eventually gave in and agreed to help.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            When I tried helping him with basic math, I soon found that
                                                            he simply couldn’t understand it. He tried, but he just
                                                            didn’t have the intellectual ability. While he struggled
                                                            with <br/>
                                                            simple arithmetic, a part of me wanted to laugh at him, just
                                                            as he had regularly laughed at me. But then something inside
                                                            me stopped me with a pointed question. I am probably
                                                            phrasing it more clearly now than I did at that age: <em>If
                                                                he mocks you for your physical limitation, and you mock
                                                                him for his intellectual limitation, how are you any
                                                                different from him?</em>
<br/>

                                                            That thought freed me from any residual resentment I might
                                                            have had about my polio. I realized that everyone struggles
                                                            with limitations. Some limitations, like mine, are visible
                                                            and obvious. Others are invisible, yet they can be equally
                                                            restrictive.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            That realization opened me to a broader reflection of life’s
                                                            fairness. I could have thought that life had been unfair to
                                                            me. I could naturally ask: “I hadn’t done anything, as far
                                                            as I knew, to deserve this disability. Why did I have to
                                                            suffer this?” But then I realized I could turn the question
                                                            around. “What had I done to deserve the intellectual ability
                                                            I enjoyed?”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            Life is unfair, but in the big picture it is <em>fairly
                                                                unfair</em>
                                                            . Sometimes we get worse than we think we deserve, but at
                                                            other times we receive better than we deserve. Maybe life is
                                                            like the clouds overhead: sometimes, they block the sun;
                                                            sometimes, they provide nourishing rains. Many years later,
                                                            when I read about the concept of karma in the Bhagavad-gita
                                                            and understood how we all carry a mixed karmic baggage from
                                                            our past into this life, I found a precise philosophical
                                                            framework to make sense of what I had experienced.<br/>

                                                            In 1996, when I was in the third year of my study of
                                                            Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at the

                                                            Bhagavad-gita through devotees who conducted college
                                                            programs. So inspired was I by its wisdom that I decided to
                                                            become a monk and dedicate my life to studying and sharing
                                                            its teachings. I have explored my rationale for this

                                                            When I expressed my desire to join the monastery in Pune,
                                                            the head asked me how I would cope with my physical
                                                            handicap. I replied that it hadn’t stopped me from staying
                                                            in a hostel without assistance, so it was unlikely to stop
                                                            me from living in a monastery. I pointed to the caliper I
                                                            wore to support my leg. To me, it had become just a part of
                                                            me, like the glasses I used to correct my vision. Every
                                                            morning I would put on my glasses, and then I would put on
                                                            the braces for my leg. The second task took more time and
                                                            was less convenient, but it didn’t make too much of a
                                                            difference. He accepted my reasoning, though I later came to
                                                            know that what persuaded him was not the force of my
                                                            argument, but the force of my conviction animating that
                                                            argument. Whatever persuaded him, I am grateful he provided
                                                            me the opportunity, which I was able to tap when I became a
                                                            monk on January 1, 1999, after I finished my graduation and
                                                            briefly worked in a multi-national software company.<br/>

                                                            Over the years, the Gita’s fundamental teaching—that we are
                                                            spiritual beings beyond our physical shells (2.13)—had
                                                            become a firm philosophical conviction for me. Even before
                                                            formally learning this truth, I didn’t identify too much
                                                            with my body; I identified far more with the thoughts in my
                                                            head. The Gita’s wisdom then helped me shift my identity
                                                            deeper still—beyond the subtle thoughts, to the spiritual
                                                            soul who is the thinker of those thoughts.<br/>

<strong>A painful fall, a peaceful heart</strong>
<br/>

<br/>
                                                            In 2011, after more than a decade in the monastery, I was
                                                            visiting the temple at Juhu, Mumbai, for giving classes.
                                                            During the morning prayer session, I slipped on some spilled
                                                            water. I fractured the hip joint of my left leg, the same
                                                            leg affected by polio. The fall was minor, but the impact
                                                            was major, because my leg was already weakened by
                                                            osteoporosis, and the caliper twisted my body as I fell.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            Intense pain shot through me, racking my body with
                                                            unbearable heat-like sensations. I had never experienced
                                                            such agony. In desperation, I tried to chant the Hare
                                                            Krishna mantra but did not feel any relief. While others
                                                            crowded around me to help, I shifted to reciting verses from
                                                            the Bhagavad-gita—and immediately, I found relief. I kept
                                                            reciting as I was taken to a nearby clinic for an X-ray and
                                                            then rushed to the Bhaktivedanta Hospital, a devotee-run
                                                            hospital about an hour and a half away. Throughout the
                                                            journey, I continued reciting the verses—most of the 700
                                                            Gita verses I had memorized.<br/>

<br/>
                                                            Physically, it was one of the most painful experiences of my
                                                            life. Yet at the level of consciousness, it was one of the
                                                            most peaceful and even joyful experiences, as I felt the
                                                            Gita’s wisdom lifting me above my body’s agony. When the
                                                            emergency doctor at the hospital saw my X-ray, he remarked,
                                                            “This cannot be your X-ray. A person with this kind of
                                                            fracture would be screaming in pain.” I smiled gratefully,
                                                            knowing that if I had any composure, it was not due to my
                                                            self-control but because Krishna, through the Gita’s wisdom,
                                                            had blessed me with absorption in Him. The fall might have
                                                            triggered a fire that was burning my bones, but the Gita had
                                                            bathed my mind in a cooling stream of nectar. From that
                                                            time, Bhagavad-gita 18.58—where Krishna declares, “If you
                                                            become conscious of Me, you will pass over all obstacles by
                                                            My grace”—has become one of my top five favorite verses.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            I had to undergo major surgery to deal with the fracture.
                                                            Because my leg was now substantially weakened and
                                                            vulnerable, I was advised to stop using the caliper and
                                                            shift to crutches instead. While this made my disability far
                                                            more visible to others, it actually made me less conscious
                                                            of it. I no longer had to spend time wearing the caliper,
                                                            and with two crutches supporting me on both sides, I could
                                                            walk much faster than before—almost keeping pace with those
                                                            who walked at a normal speed.<br/>

<strong>Across the world on crutches</strong>

                                                            Since 2014, I have been traveling on speaking engagements
                                                            almost incessantly, except during the pandemic. In the last
                                                            two years, I have hardly spent more than 15 days at my home
                                                            base in Mumbai. Interestingly, international travel has
                                                            paradoxically been less difficult than national travel.
                                                            Earlier, when I traveled by train to various youth centers
                                                            across India for outreach, the journeys were long and
                                                            strenuous. With international air travel, however,
                                                            wheelchair assistance has made the process much smoother. In
                                                            fact, I think that my traveling is more inconvenient for
                                                            those facilitating it than for me, because it is they who
                                                            have to push my wheelchair or carry my suitcase, whereas I
                                                            rarely think about my polio.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            Once, I was caught in a train for 90 hours on a journey from
                                                            Kolkata in East India to Mumbai in West India because floods
                                                            had caused the train to be delayed for several hours,
                                                            repeatedly, turning a one-day journey into a nearly four-day
                                                            journey. When any of my flights get delayed or cancelled,
                                                            and I am stuck at the airport for a few hours, I try to
                                                            remember that train journey; and my annoyance
                                                            disappears.<br/>

                                                            Nonetheless, air travel has had its adventures. Once in New
                                                            York, where I entered America after having visited
                                                            Vrindavan, India, the dust from the banks of Yamuna in
                                                            Vrindavan had got inside my crutches and it triggered a
                                                            security alarm. When the security officials stated that they
                                                            would have to break the crutches to see what was inside, I
                                                            was initially alarmed, but their concerns, and mine, were
                                                            allayed when they managed to examine the dust by opening the
                                                            crutches instead of breaking them.<br/>

                                                            Once at Hyderabad, during the security check-in, my crutches
                                                            somehow got misplaced, and the wheelchair assistants had to
                                                            help me walk the distance where the wheelchair couldn’t
                                                            reach.<br/>

                                                            For the first two decades of my speaking engagements as a
                                                            monk, I have hardly ever referred to it in my classes. But
                                                            as I became more familiar with people in different parts of
                                                            the world—people coming from diverse cultural and conceptual
                                                            backgrounds, very different from mine or the tradition I
                                                            represent—I found that the spiritual message I wanted to
                                                            share became easier for them to appreciate when I shared my
                                                            human story. And my polio, undeniably, is a significant part
                                                            of that story.<br/>

<strong>Given identity, chosen identification</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            The Bhagavad-gita does not require us to deny the material
                                                            aspects of our identity. Rather, it calls upon us to
                                                            recognize that there is more to us than our material side.
                                                            While it takes time to fully realize our spiritual
                                                            identity—and I am still on that journey—it is possible to
                                                            emotionally distance ourselves from the limiting parts of
                                                            our material identity, and to resourcefully focus on its
                                                            more positive parts. Krishna told Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita
                                                            2.13 that his essential identity is spiritual. Yet Krishna
                                                            did not tell him to reject his identity as a warrior or as a
                                                            member of an illustrious dynasty (2.14). Instead, He
                                                            instructed him to use those roles constructively—for
                                                            external service and for inner spiritual growth.<br/>

                                                            Guided by Gita wisdom, I have found it helpful to
                                                            differentiate between identity and identification. My
                                                            identity includes being male, Indian, an engineer, a polio
                                                            patient, an author, a speaker, a thinker, overweight,
                                                            dark-complexioned, short in stature, scarred on the right
                                                            side of my face. Some of these aspects are empowering, while
                                                            others feel disempowering. I do not have to reject or resent
                                                            the less favorable aspects of my identity. But I can choose
                                                            to focus on the empowering parts.<br/>

                                                            My identity as an intellectual, speaker, and author has
                                                            aided me in two of the most fulfilling features in my life:
                                                            outer contribution and inner connection. Externally, I have
                                                            been trying to provide others with resources to raise their
                                                            consciousness; internally, I have been endeavoring to
                                                            connect with my Lord Krishna, who is the center and purpose
                                                            of my life.<br/>

<br/>
                                                            To my readers who may feel disempowered by some aspect of
                                                            their present identity, I offer my heartfelt wishes: may the
                                                            wisdom of the Gita help you distance yourself from those
                                                            limiting identities. Even if only through conceptual
                                                            conviction, may you situate yourself in your spiritual
                                                            identity and identify with the roles that empower you.<br/>

                                                            This has been my journey, and I hope it will be yours
                                                            too.<br/>
