															“Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call
															this nondual substance Brahman, Paramatm or Bhagavan.” In
															today’s verse it is said, <em>tattvatah </em>
															– “in truth.” Th Absolute Truth is called <em>tattva</em>
															. One who has complete knowledge is called
															<em>tattva-vid</em>
															. Knowledge of the truth is nondual, <em>advaya-jnana</em>
															. The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of
															understanding, namely Brahman or the impersonal
															all-pervasive spirit; Paramatma, or the localized aspect of
															the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and
															Bhagavan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord
															Krishna.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Generally, those who inquire about the Absolute Truth come
															to the point of <em>brahma-jnana</em>
															. Then, if one makes further advancement, he can understand
															<em>paramatma-jnana</em>
															, then <em>bhagavad-jnana</em>
															. <em>Bhagavan iti sabdyate. </em>
															That <em>bhagavan </em>
															is Krishna. <em>Krishnas tu bhagavan svayam</em>
															: “Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead”
															(<em>Srimad-Bhagavatam </em>
															1.3.28). <em>Bhagavan </em>
															means “opulent”:<br/>

															This verse says that Bhagavan is one who possesses complete
															wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge, and renunciation.
															Nowadays there are so many so-called Bhagavans, but this is
															the first question: <em>aisvaryasya samagrasya </em>
															– do you possess all the wealth? Who can say so? A person is
															living by begging, and he’s claiming to be Bhagavan. That is
															not the definition of Bhagavan. Bhagavan must possess all
															the wealth. As stated in the <em>Bhagavad-gita </em>
															(5.29), <em>bhoktaram yajna-tapasam
																sarva-loka-mahesvaram</em>
															: “I am the proprietor of all the planetary systems, all the
															universes.” One who is begging for his livelihood and
															claiming “I am Bhagavan” does not know what Bhagavan is.
															These rascals who unnecessarily, unceremoniously claim to be
															Bhagavan do not know what Bhagavan is.<br/>

<strong>Krishna, the Cause Of All Causes</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Bhagavan is described in the <em>Brahma-samhita </em>
															(5.48):<br/>
</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">

<br/>
															“Maha-Vishnu, into whom all the innumerable universes enter
															and from whom they come forth again simply by His breathing
															process, is a plenary expansion of Krishna. Therefore I
															worship Govinda, Krishna, the cause of all causes.” This is
															one of the descriptions of Bhagavan, Govinda. Krishna is
															Govinda. <em>Govindam adi-purusham</em>
															: He’s the original, primeval Lord.<br/>

															5.1)<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Bhagavan has an unlimited number of expansions. It is
															stated, “Just as you cannot count how many waves are flowing
															in a river, similarly you cannot count how many expansions
															there are of Bhagavan.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															One of the expansions of Bhagavan is Maha-Vishnu.
															<em>Kala-viseshah. Kala </em>
															means part of the expansion – not a direct expansion, but
															part of the expansion. That is called <em>kala</em>
															. <em>Amsa-kala. Amsa </em>
															means direct expansion, and <em>kala </em>
															means expansion of the <em>amsa</em>
															. Maha-Vishnu is described as <em>kala-viseshah</em>
															, an expansion of the <em>amsa</em>
															, or a secondary expansion. And who is Maha-Vishnu? He is
															the source of millions of universes. <em>Jagad-anda </em>
															means this universe. There are millions and millions of
															universes. This universe that you are seeing is only one.
															There are millions. This information we get from the Vedic

															The <em>brahma-jyotir</em>

															<em>brahma-jyotir</em>
															. And within that <em>brahma-jyotir </em>
															there are innumerable universes. We have given the picture
															of this on the cover of our <em>Srimad-Bhagavatam</em>
															. In each universe there are innumerable planets, and all of
															this is a partial exhibition of Krishna’s potency. That is
															stated in the <em>Bhagavad-gita </em>
															(10.42):<br/>

															“But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed

															a partial exhibition of a partial expansion of Krishna.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Not for Superficial Study</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															In this way you have to study Krishna. Not that “Krishna was
															born in His maternal uncle’s house at Mathura, and He played
															with the <em>gopis </em>
															or the cowherd boys.” That is actual fact, but one should
															understand how great Krishna is. That is called
															<em>tattvatah</em>
															.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															People simply superficially study Krishna. Therefore they
															cannot understand how great Krishna is. In the Western world
															they say, “God is great.” But one should understand how
															great He is. That is <em>tattvatah</em>
															. Otherwise, we shall be misled.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<em>Avajananti mam mudha manushim tanum asritam </em>
															(<em>Gita</em>
															. 9.11). The rascals, fools, asses – <em>mudhah </em>
															means asses – deride Krishna. “Oh, Krishna I understand.
															What is that Krishna?” Not like that. Therefore Krishna
															says, <em>manushyanam sahasreshu kascid yatati siddhaye</em>
															: “Out of many, many millions of persons, one may attain
															perfection.” First of all, let someone become
															<em>siddha</em>
															. <em>Siddha </em>
															means perfect. Everyone is imperfect. Everyone commits
															mistakes, everyone becomes illusioned, everyone’s senses are
															imperfect, and everyone is a cheater. These are the
															deficiencies of the conditioned soul. One does not know what
															Krishna is, and he wants to become Krishna: “I am God. I am
															Krishna.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															This is cheating. One should understand what Krishna is.
															There are so many Vedic literatures to help you understand.
															Krishna says, <em>vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah </em>
															(<em>Gita </em>
															15.15). If you are studying the <em>Vedas</em>
															, if you are a Vedantist, then your ultimate knowledge will
															be that you have understood Krishna. If you do not
															understand Krishna, what is the use of your studying Vedanta
															and the <em>Vedas</em>
															? It is useless.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Those who are called <em>sahajiyas </em>
															think they have understood Krishna very easily: “Krishna was
															a young boy, and He was joking with the <em>gopis </em>
															and dancing with the <em>gopis</em>
															. That is Krishna. We can imitate Him. We can do what He was
															doing.” This kind of understanding means he’s a rascal; he’s
															a fool. Krishna’s dancing with the <em>gopis </em>
															is, of course, one of Krishna’s pastimes. But that is not
															the same as the pastime of an ordinary young boy and young
															girl. No. That is <em>ananda-cinmaya-rasa</em>
															, pure spiritual bliss.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Real Ananda</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															We have no understanding of <em>ananda-cinmaya-rasa</em>
															. We are accustomed to taste this material <em>ananda</em>
															, sense gratification. Here, in this material world, the
															<em>ananda </em>
															is sexual intercourse. This is the most abominable
															<em>ananda</em>
															. It is not really <em>ananda</em>
															. In the Western world we have seen that even old men,
															seventy-five years old, eighty years old, are going to the
															naked dance club for sex <em>ananda</em>
															. Because in the material world there is no <em>ananda </em>
															except this. But in the <em>Bhagavad-gita </em>
															(6.21) you’ll find, <em>sukham atyantikam yat tad
																buddhi-grahyam atindriyam</em>
															. Real <em>ananda </em>
															you have to taste with your transcendental senses, not these
															blunt senses, these covered senses. There is no question of
															tasting <em>ananda </em>
															with these senses. Those who are transcendentalists, above
															this material world, are seeking <em>ananda</em>
															. That is <em>satyananda</em>
															, real <em>ananda</em>
															. There is no end of that <em>ananda</em>
															.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Caitanya Mahaprabhu has described,
															<em>anandambudhi-vardhanam. Ambudhi </em>
															means “ocean,” and <em>vardhanam </em>
															means “increasing.” Real <em>ananda </em>
															is an ocean that is ever increasing.<br/>
															We have no experience that the sea or the ocean is
															increasing. It is decreasing. Similarly, the so-called
															<em>ananda </em>
															of this world is <em>jada</em>
															, dull.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															This is the way of understanding Krishna. In the
															<em>Caitanya-caritamrita </em>
															(<em>Adi </em>
															2.117) it is said, <em>siddhanta baliya citte na kara alasa
																iha haite krishne lage sudridha manasa</em>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															“To understand Krishna in truth, do not be lazy.” “Oh, now I
															have understood Krishna.” What have you understood? To
															understand Krishna in truth one has to devote time to
															studying the <em>Srimad-Bhagavatam</em>
															.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															First of all become fit to understand Krishna. Try to
															understand Krishna in truth, not superficially. Of course,
															the ultimate goal is to understand Krishna’s pastimes in
															Vrindavana. But first of all become <em>siddha</em>
															, perfect. Without becoming <em>siddha </em>
															you cannot understand. As long as you are <em>asiddha</em>
															, imperfect, you cannot understand Krishna. You have to
															associate with the <em>siddhas</em>
															. You have to understand Krishna in the association of
															<em>mahatmas</em>
															. And who is a <em>mahatma</em>
															? A <em>mahatma</em>
															, though apparently in this world, is not in this material
															world. He is in the spiritual world. And the result is that
															he is always engaged in the devotional service of
															Krishna.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>India’s Business</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Krishna says that it is not very easy to understand Him.
															People who think they understand Krishna very easily are
															called <em>sahajiyas</em>
															.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Krishna says that out of thousands of <em>manushyas</em>
															, or human beings, one may become perfect. Out of 8,400,000
															forms and species, there are 400,000 species of
															<em>manushya</em>
															. Out of them, one who is born in India is a first-class
															<em>manushya</em>
															. That is a fact. Unfortunately, we Indians are missing the
															chance. Caitanya Mahaprabhu said,<br/>
</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>
<em>bharata-bhumite haila</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>manushya-janma yara</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>janma sarthaka kari’</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>kara para-upakara</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br/>
															“One who has taken his birth as a human being in the land of
															India [Bharata-varsha] should make his life successful and
															work for the benefit of all other people.”
															(<em>Caitanya-caritamrita</em>
															, <em>Adi </em>
															9.41) Those who are Indians present here should know that
															after many pious activities one gets birth in India,
															<em>bharata-bhumite</em>
															. They should try to understand Krishna. There is facility
															for that: There are <em>sastras</em>
															, scriptures; Krishna personally speaks
															<em>Bhagavad-gita</em>
															; Vyasadeva speaks about Krishna in the
															<em>Srimad-Bhagavatam</em>
															. We are neglecting because we have become rascals and
															fools. This is not India’s business – to imitate economic
															development: “Money, money, money, money, money.” This is
															not India’s business. India’s business is to understand
															Krishna.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															These Americans and Europeans have come here not to see how
															much you are economically developed, industrially developed.
															They have had enough of this, more than enough. They don’t
															care for it. The modern young men do not like it. They are
															fed up. They have come here to understand Krishna.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Therefore we are trying to construct this center. Let
															everyone come, from all over the world. And it is India’s
															business to understand Krishna and help them. That is
															India’s business. The Krishna consciousness movement is a
															very serious movement. On this platform the whole world can
															be united. It is not an ordinary movement. It is based only
															on Krishna consciousness. Try to understand Krishna.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Thank you very much.<br/>
