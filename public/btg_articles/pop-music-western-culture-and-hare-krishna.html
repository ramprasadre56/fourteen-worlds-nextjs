            <em>How thousands of Soviet citizens became dedicated followers of the Krishna consciousness movement
                despite KGB persecution.</em>

            "By Krishna's grace, they said, 'Oh, no, there is nothing dangerous. They can go.' This is the country,
            Moscow. I have got practical experience in going there. And always suspicious. And the people in general,
            they are very unhappy, very unhappy, because they have no freedom. A young man cannot go out of the country.
            So, they may advertise so much, but so far I have got experience: the most wretched country. Everyone is
            fearful." (Lecture by Srila Prabhupada on December 18, 1974 in Mumbai)

        <p>
            How did it happen that thousands of Soviet citizens have become dedicated followers of the Krishna
            consciousness movement?
        </p>

        <h3>The Beginning in Moscow</h3>

        <p>
            The story begins in the early summer of 1971. One day a young Muscovite named Anatoly Pinyayev, a lab
            technician at Moscow University, and his friend, the son of an Indian diplomat, encountered a strange sight
            near Red Square—a handsome white foreigner with the shaved head and robes of an Indian priest. Stopping to
            talk with him, they learned that his name was Shyamasundara and that he was accompanying his spiritual
            master, His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who was visiting the Soviet capital at the
            invitation of Professor C. G. Kotovsky, head of the department of Indian and South Asian studies at Moscow's
            USSR Academy of Sciences.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Shyamasundara's invitation, Anatoly and his friend eagerly returned with him to the Hotel National for an
            appointment for Anatoly that would transform his life and, ultimately, the lives of thousands of Russian
            people. Anatoly was introduced to Srila Prabhupada and the two spoke for hours about how to practice Krishna
            consciousness.
        </p>

        <h3>Srila Prabhupada's Vision</h3>

        <p>
            Prabhupada saw in this young man an indication that millions of Russian people would be receptive to Krishna
            consciousness. He hoped that giving knowledge to this boy would spark a major spiritual revolution.
        </p>

        <p>
            Srila Prabhupada's hopes did not go unfulfilled. Anatoly soon became his initiated disciple, receiving the
            name Ananta-Shanti das. Over the next several years, he travelled throughout the Soviet Union, and by his
            influence hundreds of Russians—including engineers, physicists, artists, and musicians—became dedicated
            practitioners of Krishna consciousness.
        </p>

        <h3>Persecution and Perseverance</h3>

        <p>
            But things rapidly deteriorated for the budding followers of the Hare Krishna movement in Russia. By the
            mid-1980s Yuri Andropov was in power, and he intensified the campaign already underway against the Hare
            Krishna movement. He saw devotees as representing all things religious and was determined to wipe them out.
            Because of Ananta-Santi's contagious enthusiasm and the staggering results of the book fairs, Semyon
            Tsvigun, the deputy chief of the KGB under Andropov, said that the three main threats to the Soviet Union
            were "pop music, Western culture, and Hare Krishna."
        </p>

        <p>
            However later the KGB imprisoned Ananta Shanti who was then later tortured in prison and also subjected to
            severe mind-altering drugs to make him give up his Krishna Bhakti. But he never gave up.
        </p>

        <h3>A New Era</h3>

        <p>
            Today it is certainly heartening to see an erstwhile officer in the dreaded KGB (who is now the President of
            Russia) gratefully accepting a Bhagavad-gita.
