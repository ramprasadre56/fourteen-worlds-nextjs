            <strong>His Holiness Nava Yogendra Swami Maharaja</strong><br />
            <em>The Golden Jubilee of Sannyasa</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            With humble obeisances at the lotus feet of our founder-Acharya, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
            Prabhupada, the ISKCON community joyfully celebrates the 50th anniversary of the sannyasa of one of Srila
            Prabhupada's deeply beloved and dedicated disciples — His Holiness Nava Yogendra Swami Maharaja.

            Born on 12 May 1946 in Udhampur, Jammu & Kashmir, on the auspicious day of Rukmini Dvadashi, Maharaja grew
            up in a deeply devotional Vaishnava family. Even in childhood, he displayed extraordinary spiritual
            inclination — spending hours chanting, worshipping his deities, and expressing his earnest desire to become
            a sadhu. At the age of six, he even took a written vow from his mother that once his sister was married, he
            would renounce home. His early life was marked by remarkable determination, including attempts to leave home
            in search of God, inspired by the story of Dhruva Maharaja.

        <p>
            In 1974, his long-cherished spiritual search culminated in meeting His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada, who
            immediately recognized his sincerity. Srila Prabhupada initiated him as Nava Yogendra Dasa, awarded him
            brahmin initiation, and soon entrusted him with preaching responsibilities. Maharaja preached fearlessly in
            Africa, including Nairobi and Mombasa, earning Srila Prabhupada's personal blessing: "Maya cannot even touch
            you." This instruction became the guiding force of his spiritual journey.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the age of 29, Srila Prabhupada awarded him sannyasa, and by Prabhupada's special mercy, Nava Yogendra
            Swami later had the rare opportunity to serve his spiritual master personally on two occasions. For the last
            five decades, Maharaja has tirelessly travelled and preached across India and abroad, inspiring thousands
            through his simplicity, compassion, melodious kirtans, and clear explanations of scripture. Fluent in
            several languages, he communicates the message of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam with depth and
            conviction.

            As we honor this golden jubilee of his sannyasa, we offer our heartfelt prayers and gratitude.
