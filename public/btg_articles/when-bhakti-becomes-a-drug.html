<br/>
															The Silent Deviation<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<em>How seeking comfort can subtly replace true surrender in
																spiritual practice</em>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>
																By Vraja Bihari Dasa<br/>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															“<em>To show special mercy, I, dwelling in their hearts,
																destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness
																born of ignorance.” —Bhagavad-gita (10.11)</em>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															I sometimes wonder if my Krishna consciousness practices are
															a purifier or a painkiller.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															If I spend too much time on consuming news and other
															stimulating online content, then when I turn to my Krishna
															consciousness practices—like hearing and chanting—I
															inadvertently begin to seek a “kick,” a thrill, or a
															drug-like high. I start looking for lectures that entertain
															or sensationalize, or I crave extraordinary explanations and
															emotionally charged experiences. And if I don’t get that, I
															know I have YouTube, news channels, and web series to fill
															the gap. This mindset only takes me further away from
															Krishna.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Somewhere along the way, I’ve gotten the basics of Krishna
															consciousness wrong. Bhakti is not meant to give me a
															drug-like pleasure; it is meant to act as medicine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															A drug numbs or gives pleasure—it creates a temporary high,
															helping me forget my present suffering. But medicine may be
															bitter and uncomfortable at first, although it truly heals.
															That’s because it addresses the root cause.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>The deviation begins</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															When I hear the incredible verses of the Srimad-Bhagavatam
															or hear about great devotees who remained untouched by the
															material world due to their absorption in Krishna, I
															instinctively think: “I should also try not to be influenced
															by the material world.” So far, so good.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															But here’s where the deviation begins.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															In the subtle, subconscious layers of the mind, the message
															I internalize is: “I should not feel suffering, and
															therefore I should use hearing and chanting as an escape
															from pain.” I begin to approach spiritual practices not as a
															way to take shelter of Krishna, but as a way to avoid
															suffering. That’s a major deviation.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															We are meant to take shelter in hearing and chanting of
															Krishna’s names and pastimes—and as a natural result, we may
															become unaffected by the material world. But instead, we
															focus on the byproduct: “I should not be affected.” This
															byproduct becomes our goal, and so, our hearing and chanting
															is no longer about shelter—it becomes a tool for pain
															relief. That’s when everything shifts. Our practices subtly
															change.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															We begin to crave relief more than Krishna. We use
															<em>hari-nama</em>
															and <em>krishna-katha</em>
															as a drug.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															When we treat Krishna consciousness like a drug, we
															unconsciously look for: comfort, not confrontation; escape,
															not engagement; emotional highs, not heart surgery.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															When we treat it as medicine, we say: “Let me taste the
															bitterness too, if that’s what will cleanse me.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The advanced practitioners, however, don’t approach Krishna
															consciousness to escape suffering—they embrace suffering if
															it helps them serve Krishna more deeply. They see hearing
															and chanting as an end in itself.<br/>

<p>
<br/>
															But we may, unconsciously, take to Krishna consciousness for
															comfort. That’s why we seek performance-based classes—those
															with music, jokes, and pleasing vibes. We forget that
															Krishna consciousness has two aspects:<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															1. The medicine of hearing the harsh truths about this
															material world.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															2. The sweetness of Krishna’s pastimes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															We need both <em>karela</em>
															and <em>gulabjamun.</em>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Our classes should disturb us a little—they should shake us
															into confronting the realities of death, time, detachment,
															and the urgent need to surrender. But instead, we avoid
															difficult discussions. We want to feel good. We seek the
															“drug” instead of the “medicine,” because we desire
															happiness—not Krishna’s happiness, but our version of
															happiness.<br/>
</p>

<p>
<br/>
															Fast food is quick, tasty, and gratifying—but in the
															long-term it weakens the body. A home-cooked meal may take
															effort, discipline, and lacks addictive flavor—but it
															nourishes and sustains. Likewise, classes or chanting that
															are only “spiced up” to entertain may delight us like
															spiritual fast food. But steady, sattvic practice—sometimes
															bland, sometimes spicy—is what truly strengthens bhakti.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Can Krishna consciousness heal everything?</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															We enjoy <em>krishna-katha,</em>
															but we often avoid addressing deeper emotional issues—like
															family conflict, heartbreak, anxiety, or loneliness—and end
															up practicing a form of spiritual bypassing. It’s
															heartbreaking to see how often devotees try to heal deep
															emotional wounds through chanting alone, thinking that
															chanting will solve everything and no other support is
															needed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Yes, ultimately chanting can heal everything. But to really
															allow that healing to happen, we must accept the full scope
															of Krishna consciousness. Sometimes, Krishna may even give
															us more suffering—not less. This could be His mercy, meant
															to burn off lifetimes of karma and false ego. Yet, we
															glorify suffering as Krishna’s blessing in public classes,
															but in our private lives, we desperately want to be free
															from it. We want Krishna to assist in our plans to be
															permanently happy in this material world—not to take us out
															of it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															That’s when we start using Krishna consciousness as a
															drug:<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															· Stimulating lectures.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															· Emotionally charged kirtans.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															· Spiritual highs that keep my inner questions at bay.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															And even though these things are good and necessary, my
															internal mood should be different. My prayer should be: “I
															am Yours, O Krishna. Please help me serve You. Help me face
															the difficult questions. Let me know that I am suffering,
															let me see that the material world is broken, and let me
															long only for You.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>We cry …. but for the wrong reasons</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Right now, I cry not because I miss Krishna, but because the
															material world is hurting me. I pray not to deepen my
															relationship with Krishna, but to get relief. I want God to
															help me succeed in my version of a peaceful material
															life.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															But if I truly want to return to Krishna—if my tears are
															real tears of separation—I’ll be willing to hear the
															difficult truths. I’ll welcome challenging conversations,
															not just comforting ones. In any genuine relationship, not
															all talks are easy or happy—some are hard, but
															necessary.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															In a way, these are not yet tears of separation from
															Krishna, but tears of frustration with material existence.
															Still, they’re valuable. Even the wrong reason to chant can
															lead to the right heart, if we stay honest and keep walking.
															A bad reason to start chanting is better than no reason at
															all—if it becomes a gateway to sincerity.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															There’s a subtle Westernized (even consumerist) notion of
															spirituality: that it should make us feel “uplifted” or
															“positive.” But real bhakti can be a heavy confrontation
															with our ego. Like the Desert Fathers of Christianity who
															entered solitude not to feel peace but to fight demons, a
															mature devotee enters Krishna consciousness ready for
															war—not just for bliss.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Seeking Comfort versus Truth</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Those who take it as medicine will ask serious questions and
															seek answers from scripture. And that’s the turning point —
															moving from a comfort-seeker to a truth-seeker.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Srila Prabhupada called bhakti “the cooling balm” and “the
															soothing process”—but it still penetrates deep, uproots the
															<em>anarthas,</em>
															and heals us. It’s sweet like nectar, but transformative
															like lightning.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															It was Thomas Merton who said, “Spiritual life is not a dry,
															bloodless elevation. It is a consuming fire.” If our bhakti
															is just a tranquilizer, we may never become the kind of soul
															Krishna longs to see. But when we start allowing it to
															become a medicine—even if bitter—then we’re being prepared
															not just to feel relief, but to receive real love.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Krishna consciousness is meant to cure our disease of
															material attachment, not just soothe our symptoms. And
															unless we approach it with sobriety, surrender, and a
															willingness to face what hurts, we risk staying spiritually
															stagnant—even while appearing spiritually active.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															If I understand Krishna consciousness as medicine, I’ll
															accept the pain and healing as part of the process. But if I
															see it as a drug, I’ll only seek relief and pleasure. If
															it’s medicine, I’ll ask deep questions, seek real answers,
															and be open to hearing the Srimad-Bhagavatam in its full
															depth—not just the sweet and soothing parts.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															At the start of the Bhagavad-gita, Arjuna seeks relief from
															the battlefield’s horror. But Krishna doesn’t pacify him
															emotionally—instead, He gives philosophy, truth, and a call
															to duty. He also instructs him, “The person who is not
															disturbed by happiness and distress and is steady in both is
															certainly eligible for liberation.” (Gita 2.15). Krishna
															urges Arjuna to become <em>titikshavah </em>
															(“tolerant”). He doesn’t give relief but calls for inner
															transformation.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>Accepting the unpalatable</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															When asked if Krishna consciousness would solve all the
															world’s problems, Srila Prabhupada said, “We are not so much
															concerned with problems. We are concerned with
															self-realization.” He was clear that bhakti is not to make
															our life better—it is to make us better.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															He often said, “If you want to be cheated, there are many
															cheaters. But if you want truth, you must be ready to accept
															what is not palatable.” He never diluted the philosophy for
															emotional pleasure. Thomas Kempis, in his <em>Imitation of
																Christ</em>
															said, “If you seek comfort in this world, you will never be
															comforted by God. Blessed is the one who chooses the truth,
															even when it burns.” The famous author, C.S. Lewis wrote,
															“We are not necessarily doubting that God will do the best
															for us; we are wondering how painful the best will turn out
															to be.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Our relationship with Krishna matures when we stop wanting
															Him just to make us happy and start wanting Him even if it
															breaks us. Real love says: “Wound me if You must, but don’t
															leave me ignorant.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The soul has two paths in spiritual life: it can seek
															Krishna as a balm, or it can surrender to Krishna as the
															surgeon.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The first path—using Krishna consciousness as a drug—feels
															easier. We take shelter of <em>kirtana,</em>
															classes, chanting, or good association not to transform, but
															to temporarily dull the ache of <em>samsara.</em>
															It feels spiritual, even devotional, but deep down it can be
															just another layer of <em>anartha—</em>
															a refined, subtle form of sense gratification which acts as
															emotional relief rather than spiritual rebirth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The second path—the medicine path—is much harder. It means
															being willing to hurt if it will help. It means accepting
															that Krishna will not always comfort us, but He will always
															cleanse us. Like Kunti Devi, the mother of the Pandavas,
															praying “Let calamities come again and again,” or the
															<em>gopis</em>
															lamenting Krishna’s absence—real bhakti often deepens
															through discomfort, not delight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															We want Krishna to assist us in our plans for being
															permanently happy in the material world. That is perhaps the
															root of the drug mentality. It’s not atheistic. It’s not
															even overtly selfish. It’s just misaligned. We don’t want to
															serve Krishna’s plan — we want Krishna to bless our plan.
															And as long as we do that, our bhakti will be subtly
															self-centered.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															In an amusement park, you come to escape reality, feel high,
															and be entertained. In a school, you come to learn, get
															corrected, and sometimes feel uncomfortable—but you graduate
															wiser. If we treat temples, retreats, and <em>kirtanas</em>
															like amusement parks, we’ll seek highs and avoid homework.
															But Krishna consciousness is educational — a place to be
															taught, not just tickled. If we only want feel-good,
															goosebumps-style bhakti, we’re asking for an amusement park
															ride. But Krishna consciousness, like a school, includes
															correction, contemplation, even occasional confrontation
															with truth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															In amusement parks, you skip the hard stuff. In school, you
															take tests—they’re unpleasant but necessary. Similarly,
															Krishna tests us—not to fail us, but to reveal us to
															ourselves.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Bhakti as a drug gives a high; bhakti as medicine gives
															depth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>The true healing</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															True healing begins the moment we stop begging Krishna to
															make our life more comfortable and start begging Him to make
															our heart more surrendered. So now, when I chant<br/>
															or hear, I am trying to ask myself: “Am I taking this as a
															painkiller?” Or “Am I letting this become a spiritual
															surgery?”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The holy name is both: it is the sweetest relief and the
															deepest purification. But it becomes medicine only if I let
															it expose, cut, and heal the disease of wanting anything
															other than Him. Krishna consciousness sometimes gives us
															temporary relief. But its real purpose is to cure us—of
															lifetimes of rebellion against Krishna.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															So, let me chant attentively, prayerfully, and soberly. Not
															to feel a drug-like ecstasy, but to become steady,
															surrendered, and truly healed. Let me grow sober in
															bhakti.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															A tourist only visits when the weather is nice. A farmer
															works in all seasons—knowing even storms are necessary for a
															good harvest. A “drug” devotee prays and chants only when
															the mood is nice. A “medicine” devotee accepts Krishna in
															sunshine and in storms—because they want the harvest:
															<em>prema.</em>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Tourist bhakti is seasonal—when things go well, when the
															<em>kirtana</em>
															is melodious, when classes are light, when there’s time and
															mood. Farmer bhakti is faithful—he chants even when the mind
															screams, listens even when the topic stings, and serves even
															when no one claps.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															A tourist looks for a photos, selfies and postcard; a farmer
															waits for a harvest. In bhakti, the harvest is not feeling
															better—it’s becoming surrendered. Farmers accept the
															necessary suffering: plowing hard earth, breaking stones,
															working under sun and storm. Similarly, a serious
															practitioner of bhakti digs into hard habits, endures inner
															dryness, and still continues.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															“No rain, no grain.” In spiritual life: no struggle, no
															realization.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Tourists are here for moments; farmers are here for seasons.
															Devotees who see Krishna consciousness as medicine are in
															for life—they may not always enjoy it, but they trust the
															process.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															A tourist wants experience — “Was it fun?”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															A farmer wants results — “Did it grow?”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The tourist returns home with photos; the farmer returns
															home with grain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The amusement park gives memories; the school gives
															maturity.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Let us not reduce Krishna consciousness to a feel-good show.
															Let us sweat in the field like a farmer, sit attentively in
															the classroom like a sincere student, and take the bitter
															medicine with gratitude—because it is curing the soul, not
															just comforting the ego.<br/>
