															We’re all looking for someone special, a friend that stands
															out among all the others, our best friend forever (BFF). In
															the Gita, Krishna tells us that He is our “most dear
															friend.” And in the purport of this verse, ISKCON
															founder-<em>acharya </em>
															His Divine GraceA. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
															explains in his Gita commentary that “Krishna is the supreme
															living entity. And since Krishna is the source of our
															generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better
															friend than Krishna, nor can anyone be a better
															well-wisher.”<br/>

<br/>
															But sometimes, even though Krishna Himself is confirming
															that we are dear to Him, it can be hard to believe. Suppose
															you’re coming to spirituality from a background of atheism
															or agnosticism. Something you experienced or witnessed has
															made you curious about God. You’re now convinced that this
															higher power exists, and that He’s called Krishna. And the
															deeper you go into spirituality, the more you’ll understand
															what Srila Prabhupada meant when he called devotion a
															science. It’s logical and valiantly defeats each argument
															against spirituality. Krishna consciousness shines bright
															among other philosophies and belief systems. You can study
															and study and understand everything theoretically. You can
															become sure that Krishna exists, because it’s the most
															logical conclusion one can reach.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															But it can still leave you feeling hollow, because
															connecting with Krishna isn’t about intelligence or study —
															not primarily, anyway. It’s about love. It’s possible to
															argue passionately about the existence of God but still not
															feel loved by Him. There can be a supportive community
															around you but spirituality can still feel like a lonely
															endeavor. Because the idea that He might love you makes you
															sceptical. After you first rejected Him, by not being a
															devotee in the past, you might wonder why He would now
															accept you. Such doubts are laced with guilt and fear and
															are entirely normal.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The scriptures affirm that Krishna’s love for us is an
															eternal, universal fact. He sits within all of our hearts
															and He loves us even when we don’t love Him back. He guides
															us even when we don’t want to listen. He showers mercy upon
															us even when we think we’re doing it all on our own. He
															protects us even when we think we’re strong enough to take
															care of ourselves. By living in the material world, we’re
															already distanced from Him, but He goes so far as to grant
															us forgetfulness if we want to separate from Him even more
															than we already are. He behaves with us however we wish to
															see Him, be it as a friend, as the Almighty, as a child, a
															lover, a story, a fact. He will become, for us, whatever we
															want Him to be. That’s the extent of His love for us.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Yet you might have a hard time believing you’re loved by
															Krishna. If you slack with your spiritual practices like
															chanting or following the regulative principles, or do
															something that you think has upset Him, you’ll suspect that
															His love for you is now gone, if it was even there to begin
															with in the first place. For some people, love is a natural
															bond that forms. For others, insecurity and fear get in the
															way. And even though we hear every day that Krishna loves
															His devotees, we might find reasons to exclude ourselves
															from that fact.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The solution here doesn’t lie in studying more vigorously or
															making declarations about the Supreme more handsomely. The
															answer is two pronged — it’s one, about our endeavour to
															contain our insecurities; and two, praying to Krishna so He
															can help us feel His love and presence. Nothing is ever
															going to be achieved without Krishna’s blessing, and so
															praying is essential. But the thing that, above all, is in
															our hands is our perspective.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															In her 2011 TED talk “The Power of Vulnerability,” which has
															over 23 million views on YouTube, social work researcher
															Breni Brown speaks about how, in order for connections to
															form, we have to embrace vulnerability and let ourselves be
															truly seen. After collecting thousands of pieces of data,
															she explains how, if she took those people as a whole, they
															could be divided into two groups — those who have a sense of
															worthiness and those who struggle with it. “There was only
															one variable that separated the people who have a strong
															sense of love and belonging and people who really struggle
															for it. And that was, people who have a strong sense of love
															and belonging, believe they’re worthy of love and belonging.
															That’s it,” she says in the talk.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Krishna’s love is a fact. But do we believe we deserve it?
															Do we feel worthy of it?<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															The key to shifting our perspective and believing we are
															worthy of love is noticing Krishna’s presence in our life
															and being grateful for what we have. For starters, He gave
															us this human form and led us to bhakti. Of the many
															millions of souls in the universe, we are the ones who are
															connected with one of His temples. He certainly wants us to
															learn about Him and share love with Him. He’s also given us
															today, another day to further our spirituality and elevate
															our consciousness, so we can reach Him sooner. Through
															sending his confidential messengers like Srila Prabhupada
															for us, He’s given us immeasurable guidance, passionate and
															compassionate teachers, temples we can call homes all over
															the world. Krishna is ensuring our spiritual growth is well
															taken care of, whatever corner of the world we’re in — the
															sooner to see us.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															When you feel guilt about your past, practice
															self-compassion. When you feel a sense of fear, remind
															yourself that Krishna isn’t a rude or vindictive God. He’s
															patient and kind and brimming with compassion. When you’re
															feeling disconnected, engage with His devotees. When you’re
															feeling distant from Him, chant His holy names. When you’re
															feeling empty, eat His leftovers. Essentially, follow the
															process. And remember to be grateful.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															And before long, we’ll be back with Him:<br/>
</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>
<em>man-mana bhava mad-bhakto</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>mad-yaji mam namaskuru</em>

<p>
<br/>
															“Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer
															your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail.
															I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.”
															(<em>Bhagavad-gita As It Is, </em>
															18.65)<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Again, He’s reminding us that we are His “very dear friend.”
															All we need do is follow the process. And we’ll be in front
															of Him sooner than we imagine.<br/>
