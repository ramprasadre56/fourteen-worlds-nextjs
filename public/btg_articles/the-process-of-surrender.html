<em>Lord Krishna’s main message in the Bhagavad-gita is

                                                            THE MOST VITAL part of the <em>Bhagavad-gita</em>
                                                            deals with the advice Lord Sri Krishna gives to Arjuna on
                                                            the surrendering process. One of the dictionary meanings of
                                                            <em>surrender</em>
                                                            is “to give (something) up voluntarily to another.” Lord
                                                            Krishna’s simple words of advice on surrendering are easy to
                                                            understand. So why do most people, including those of us
                                                            practicing Krishna consciousness, not fully surrender to the
                                                            Lord? We are practicing spiritual life in the material
                                                            world, a prison created by the Lord to reform us and to help
                                                            us surrender to Him. Krishna is very keen to get us back
                                                            home, back to Godhead. But are we so keen?<br/>

                                                            elaborated on the three modes of material nature—goodness,
                                                            passion, and ignorance—in Chapter 14. When we are in contact

                                                            understand what surrender really means. Krishna calls such
                                                            persons grossly foolish.<br/>

                                                            When I visited the Srinivasa Temple in Malibu, near Los
                                                            Angeles, an Indian businessman had come to the temple with
                                                            plenty of fruits and flowers.<br/>

                                                            , he told him, “Please pray that my new business venture

                                                            entirely on Krishna. So we must leave it to Him instead of
                                                            asking.”<br/>

                                                            Pure devotional service means to understand the absolute

                                                            Krishna lays down the conditions under which one can
                                                            surrender to Him and go back home, back to Godhead. Pride,
                                                            lust, unfavorable association, material conditioning, and
                                                            the dualities of happiness and suffering are all impediments
                                                            to the surrendering process. The practitioner of devotional
                                                            service must practice with care in order to gradually

                                                            The surrendering process starts with self-appraisal. That is
                                                            the beginning of renunciation both internally and
                                                            externally.<br/>

                                                            Preparing the devotee arjuna for total surrender, Krishna
                                                            elaborates on the surrendering process in Chapter 18, Text
                                                            65:<br/>

<strong>Examples from Scripture</strong>

<br/>
                                                            From the scriptures, especially <em>Srimad-Bhagavatam</em>
                                                            and <em>Mahabharata</em>
                                                            , we are aware of the histories of pure devotees who have
                                                            shown us the way of total surrender to Lord Krishna. When Du
                                                            &amp;!asana tried to disrobe Draupadi, she held on to her
                                                            sari with her own strength. She wanted to save herself from
                                                            disgrace in the assembly. Only when her full endeavor could
                                                            not help her anymore did she lift both hands and surrender
                                                            to Krishna, begging Him to save her. That was her expression
                                                            of total surrender.<br/>

                                                            The scriptures also give the surrendering histories of
                                                            devotees such as Bali Maharaja, Ambarisha Maharaja, and
                                                            Gajendra. They are all our role models for the surrendering
                                                            process.<br/>

<strong>Surrender Made Easier</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            The renunciation expected for full surrender appears
                                                            difficult, especially in this age. Foreseeing this
                                                            situation, Krishna appeared in the fifteenth century in
                                                            devotee form as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to simplify the
                                                            process of surrender. He focused on chanting Hare Krishna,
                                                            Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare
                                                            Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            Chaitanya Mahaprabhu taught His associates and devotees the
                                                            process of surrender to Krishna through deity worship,
                                                            congregational chanting, honoring Krishna-prasadam,
                                                            associating with likeminded devotees, hearing and reciting
                                                            scriptures like Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita, and
                                                            searching for Krishna like a child crying for its mother.
                                                            Srila Prabhupada publicized this process and made it
                                                            accessible through his books.<br/>

                                                            Drawing from Srila Prabhupada’s books, we can understand
                                                            that for devotees on the path of <em>sadhana-bhakti</em>
                                                            (devotional service in practice) who want quick advancement
                                                            in spiritual life, surrender means:<br/>

                                                            1. To give ourselves completely to Lord Krishna and depend
                                                            entirely on Him for protection.<br/>

                                                            Krishna will protect us.<br/>

                                                            3. To be ready to accept all that is ordained for us and all
                                                            karmic reactions, whether desirable or undesirable.<br/>

                                                            4. To realize that the real doer is Krishna and that we
                                                            depend on Him for any results.<br/>

                                                            5. To understand fully that Krishna is the infinite
                                                            controller and that we are His infinitesimal controlled<br/>

                                                            6. To realize that we are not the body but the spirit
                                                            soul.<br/>

                                                            7. To accept that Krishna is the master and we the
                                                            servitors.<br/>

                                                            8. To follow the instruction of Krishna that we should
                                                            accept a bona fide spiritual master in the succession as
