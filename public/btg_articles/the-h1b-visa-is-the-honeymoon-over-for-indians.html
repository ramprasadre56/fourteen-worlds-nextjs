                                                            The H-1B visa is a work visa that’s valid for three years
                                                            and can be renewed for another three years. The program
                                                            allows US companies to maintain competitiveness and grow
                                                            their business, creating more jobs in the US.<br/>

                                                            But US President Trump increased the visa fees from
                                                            approximately 2500-5000 dollars to 100,000 dollars setting
                                                            shock waves throughout H1B aspirants in India. This is set
                                                            to disproportionately impact skilled professionals from
                                                            India, who have consistently accounted for the majority of
                                                            approved applications in recent years, threatening to upend
                                                            the career paths of hundreds of thousands of individuals
                                                            and, more importantly, disrupt the business models of tech
                                                            firms reliant on global talent.<br/>

                                                            For decades, the H-1B visa has served as a gateway for some
                                                            of India’s brightest minds to enter the US workforce, acting
                                                            as a crucial launchpad for building long-term careers in
                                                            America.<br/>

                                                            The most striking evidence of this success is visible across
                                                            the top leadership of today’s tech giants: Microsoft’s Satya
                                                            Nadella, Alphabet’s (Google’s) Sundar Pichai, IBM’s Arvind
                                                            Krishna, and Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen were all born in India
                                                            and earned degrees from American universities, after earning
                                                            basic engineering degrees from Indian universities.<br/>

                                                            ISKCON too has benefitted from the Indian diaspora which
                                                            accounts for accepting a sizeable chunk of responsibility in
                                                            maintaining as well as managing its temples and farm
                                                            communities in the USA. It is high time to formulate
                                                            strategies to address this situation.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            When Srila Prabhupada began the movement in New York in
                                                            1966, he had almost zero support from any Indian nationals,
                                                            whether from India or those settled in America. He
                                                            single-handedly cultivated his followers, who were mostly
                                                            from the counter-culture from the East Coast or hippies from
                                                            the West Coast. It is remarkable what Srila Prabhupada
                                                            accomplished in the first three to four years before he
                                                            ventured back to India.<br/>

<br/>
                                                            In fact, there is a narrative that Srila Prabhupada
                                                            protested to Lord Sri Krishna as to why is He dragging him
                                                            back to India, when the country had shown zero interest in
                                                            the message of Sri Krishna. But Srila Prabhupada did come
                                                            back and started major projects in India with Sridhama
                                                            Mayapur, Vrindavan, Mumbai and Hyderabad among the notable
                                                            ones.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            While in India he began to exhort Indians by saying, “If you
                                                            think that you want to understand through science and
                                                            philosophy, we have got three dozen books. Anyway, you come.
                                                            That is our appeal. Don’t take this movement neglectfully.
                                                            It is a very serious movement, this Krishna consciousness
                                                            movement, and it is the duty for all Indians, as Chaitanya
                                                            Mahaprabhu predicted: <em>bharata-bhumite haila
                                                                manushya-janma yara / janma sarthaka kari’ kara
                                                                para-upakara </em>
                                                            (<em>Cc. Adi</em>
                                                            9.41): “One who has taken his birth as a human being in the
                                                            land of India [Bharata-varsha] should make his life
                                                            successful and work for the benefit of all other
                                                            people.”<br/>

                                                            It is to the great credit of Indians who settled in America
                                                            to have begun exploring their spiritual roots through the
                                                            ISKCON movement. Indeed, there are many examples of families
                                                            who admit that they did not visit any temple while in India,
                                                            but now they are committed members of their local
                                                            congregation. They attest to the fact that Srila
                                                            Prabhupada’s presentation of India’s original culture has
                                                            made all the difference in their lives.<br/>

                                                            In fact, echoing the words of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu,
                                                            Srila Prabhupada emphasized this urgency. He proclaimed:
                                                            “There is a great need for this movement. We want hundreds
                                                            and thousands of preachers to go outside India and preach
                                                            this religion. And there are customers ready. Wherever we
                                                            are opening our branches, it appears as if they are awaiting
                                                            our arrival. Immediately they take it up. So, there is very
                                                            great opportunity.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
                                                            Now, we are analyzing the situation as Srila Prabhupada
                                                            faced it in the early to late 1970’s. This was the situation
                                                            at that time, so see it in proper perspective. He further
                                                            says to Indians: “You cannot compete with the Western
                                                            countries by your technology. However, you may make some
                                                            sewing machine or cycle or Ambassador car. They are hundred
                                                            years ahead. You cannot make any competition by machine. If
                                                            you can give them anything and glorify your country, then
                                                            this is this movement, Krishna consciousness. Then they will
                                                            admit that you have something worthwhile.<br/>

                                                            Paying heed to the clarion call of Shri Chaitanya
                                                            Mahaprabhu, Indians have to keep the message of preaching
                                                            Bhagavad-gita in the forefront of their life, and ISKCON
                                                            managers in the USA have to re-focus on their efforts to use
                                                            the existing contingent of Indians settled there to attract
                                                            the local population as was done by Srila Prabhupada
                                                            himself. That task is by no means easy, but at the present
                                                            moment following Srila Prabhupada’s personal example seems
                                                            to be the best foot forward.<br/>
