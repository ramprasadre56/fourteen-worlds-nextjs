<em>
																Devotional insights into the song that Srila

															</em>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>
																By Chaitanya Charana Dasa<br/>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>1.1 Let me treasure the opportunity, even when
																bereft of facility</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>boro-krpa kaile krishna adhamer prati</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<em>Such immense mercy have you shown,</em>
<em>O Krishna, upon this soul, fallen and forlorn.</em>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															My dear Lord, how stunning is the consciousness of the
															saints devoted to you—as seen in Srila Prabhupada, who
															declared that he had received immense mercy from you. Yet,
															to any ordinary eye, no mercy is visible. He stands alone—no
															followers accompanying him, none awaiting him. He has no
															institutional support. His material means are almost
															nothing—just forty rupees. The only resource he
															possesses—his own body—has endured two heart attacks on
															successive nights during his voyage.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															In such dire circumstances, what does he see as your mercy,
															O inconceivable Lord? Simply the fact that he has reached
															America after that perilous journey. He now has a chance to
															fulfill his spiritual master’s instruction—to share bhakti
															with the Western world. Though he has no facility to carry
															out that mission, he is profoundly grateful that he has, at
															least, the opportunity.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															O Lord Almighty, a heart devoted to you sees beyond the
															circumstantial to the transcendental—from scarcity to
															sanctity, from trial to trust. Help me focus on what you
															have done, not on what you have not yet done—or what may
															seem to have been undone by you. Inspired by your pure
															devotee’s vision, bless me, during my moments of test, to
															manifest even a fraction of such devotional
															appreciation—focusing on what I have, not on what I
															lack.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>1.2 Let me behold you above and the path to you
																below</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>ki lagiyanile hetha koro ebe gati</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Why have you brought me to this place?</em>
<em>Now do with me as suits your grace.</em>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															My dear Lord, please bless me to entrust myself into your
															hands, just as Srila Prabhupada did when he arrived in
															America—uncertain of what exactly he would do but certain
															that you were guiding him. Grant me the conviction that you
															are always orchestrating my circumstances from above and
															guiding my steps on the path below.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															O omnipresent Lord, let my consciousness of you become an
															empowering blend of practical consciousness and
															transcendental consciousness. Practical consciousness will
															keep me aware of my immediate situation—its challenges and
															opportunities. Transcendental consciousness will keep me
															aware that you are always in charge. If I have only
															practical consciousness without transcendental
															consciousness, I will be consumed by anxiety and paralyzed
															by panic. If I have neither practical nor transcendental
															consciousness, I will be lost in my head, unable to do
															anything worthwhile. If I have only transcendental
															consciousness without practical consciousness, I will become
															unrealistic — over-dependent on your intervention without
															doing my part.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															Bless me, O almighty Lord, to cultivate both. Let
															transcendental consciousness keep me faithful and calm, and
															let practical consciousness keep me resourceful and alert.
															Thus, like Srila Prabhupada, may my head remain in the sky
															while my feet stay firmly on the ground, as I walk the path
															of your service.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>2.1 Grant me humble confidence in divine
																providence</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>ache kichu karja taba ei anumane</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<em>You must have some purpose, I humbly guess,</em>
<em>Some hidden aim in this wilderness.</em>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															My dear Lord, Srila Prabhupada reveals the disarming blend
															of certainty and uncertainty that marks bhakti in this
															world. He is confident that you have a plan, while humbly
															acknowledging that he can only infer its details. His
															uncertainty does not arise from a deficiency of devotion but
															from the finiteness of the soul—a finiteness that remains,
															however spiritually exalted one may be.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															When he uses the word anumane (“I guess”), this uncertainty
															is not a <em>dushana</em>
															(a defect) but a <em>bhushana</em>
															(an ornament). It reveals how deep his conviction runs, even
															when complete clarity lies beyond human reach.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															I am forever a part of you—eternally finite—whereas you, my
															Lord, are eternally infinite. Your plan is never fully or
															finally known to anyone but yourself. Let my devotion to you
															lead me to the humility of a heart aware of the limits of
															human perception.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															O Supreme Guide, bless me to follow in Srila Prabhupada’s
															illustrious footsteps and cultivate a humble confidence in
															your providence—especially when what is happening, or what I
															am meant to do, lies beyond my comprehension. May my heart,
															like Srila Prabhupada’s, remain steady and surrendered,
															trusting your plan even when my mind cannot trace it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>2.2 Prosperity without you is invisible
																poverty</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>nahe keno aniben ei ugra-sthane</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Why else would you bring me to such a terrible
																place</em>
<em>—So lost in illusion, so void of grace?</em>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															My dear Lord, great devotees are never enamored by material
															opulence, as seen in Srila Prabhupada’s description of
															America as an ugra-sthan—a terrible place. While most people
															across the world, including India, dream of America as a
															land of liberty, opportunity, and prosperity, Srila
															Prabhupada saw it differently: as a land spiritually
															impoverished, where people knew neither you nor love for
															you. Outwardly, they appeared prosperous; inwardly, they
															were impoverished, struggling to find lasting meaning or
															joy. Yet Srila Prabhupada’s vision was not one of
															condemnation but of compassion.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															O Lord of Vrindavan, he came from a land where nearly every
															heart beat with your name, to a land where your name was
															scarcely known. Though he had left Vrindavan outwardly, his
															heart had never left it. Indeed, we may take a devotee out
															of Vrindavan, but we cannot take Vrindavan out of the
															devotee. Srila Prabhupada carried Vrindavan within his heart
															and longed to manifest it in America.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															O Lord of love, bless me that I may never be captivated by
															material prosperity but remain ever dedicated to devotion—to
															seeking it, savoring it, and sharing it. May I, in my small
															way, follow Srila Prabhupada by carrying the essence of
															Vrindavan within me wherever I go, and may my life become a
															window through which your holy abode shines into this
															world.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>3.1 Guard me from the spell of the progress that
																increases distress</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>rajas tamo gune era sabai acchanna</strong>
															 <br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<em>By rajas and tamas in formidable might,</em>
<em>All here are covered in illusion’s night.</em>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
															My dear Lord, Srila Prabhupada’s devotion is founded on deep
															scriptural erudition: he sees America not as a land filled
															with majestic architecture, impressive technology, or <br/>
															dazzling prosperity, but as a land dominated by the lower
															modes of material nature—those subtle forces that shape the
															interaction between matter and consciousness. He sees
															especially the modes of passion and ignorance, which are
															dangerously misleading and entangling. Despite America’s
															many claims to progress, he perceives growing
															distress—evident in the alarming rise of psychological and
															social disintegration across much of Western society.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															O all-seeing Lord, the mode of passion fills me with
															infatuation, which lasts as long as I believe that material
															pleasure is both attainable and enjoyable. But when that
															hope fades—when pleasure becomes unavailable or
															unfulfilling—the mode of ignorance drags me into dejection
															and depression. And thus, I miss the precious window for
															introspection and spiritual redirection.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															O merciful Lord, it is only when saints like Srila
															Prabhupada enter my life that I can recognize that
															window—and, by their mercy, turn it into a doorway to
															devotional flourishing. Bless me with the strength to first
															free myself from the shackles of these modes—and then to
															assist Srila Prabhupada and his followers in freeing others
															as well.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>3.2 Lift m  y vision from condemnation to
																compassion</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>basudeb-katha ruci nahe se prasanna</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<em>For Vasudeva’s glories, they have no attraction</em>
<br/>
<em>In the divine, they find no satisfaction.</em>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															My dear Lord, this prayer reveals that Srila Prabhupada’s
															earlier description of America as <em>ugra-sthana</em>
															—a terrible place—was not condemnation but compassion. His
															concern was never that America’s material progress was bad,
															but that it diverted people from the immense spiritual joy
															of remembering and loving you.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															O source of all joy, that compassion arose from a joy he had
															known since childhood. As a toddler he would awaken each
															morning to the sound of his father’s <em>arati</em>
															—the ringing bells becoming his first memory of the day. It
															was that joy which he celebrated when he organized the
															Ratha-yatra festival in his neighborhood as a child. It was
															that same joy which inspired him later to shift from being a
															political freedom fighter for India to becoming a spiritual
															missionary for India’s bhakti treasures.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
															O Lord who grants conviction, Srila Prabhupada is fully
															convinced that no joy even remotely compares with the joy of
															loving you. Grant me a fraction of his conviction, that I
															may accept the gift of divine love he offers and share it
															with others—not by guilting them for their ignorance, not by
															judging them for their blindness, but by gently guiding them
															toward your light.<br/>
