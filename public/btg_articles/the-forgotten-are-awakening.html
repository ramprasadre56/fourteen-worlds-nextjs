                                                            From the sacred grounds of Sridhama Mayapur, the global
                                                            spiritual headquarters of ISKCON, a historic gathering
                                                            unfolded earlier this year—one that reaffirmed Srila
                                                            Prabhupada’s prophetic vision to bring Krishna consciousness
                                                            to every town and village, including the often-forgotten

                                                            The Ninth Annual Tribal Care Convention, organized by the

                                                            was more than a mere event. It was a yajna of service, a
                                                            congregation of courage, and a declaration of spiritual
                                                            selfhood for over 3,000 tribal devotees who travelled from
                                                            the deep forests and remote villages of Assam, Tripura,

                                                            Mayapur, the lotus seat of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s

                                                            reflections from leaders, and testimonies from the ground,
                                                            piecing together a living narrative of how the holy name is
                                                            transforming lives in places the world seldom sees.<br/>

                                                            Speaking to <em>BacktoGodhead</em>
                                                            , Sri GovindaDasa, Secretary of ITCT, shared the deeper
                                                            intention behind the convention: “We’re not organizing just
                                                            an event—we’re facilitating a <em>spiritual homecoming</em>
                                                            . These devotees live in hardship, but their hearts are rich
                                                            in simplicity and faith. Our duty is not to change who they
                                                            are, but to nurture what’s divine in them.”<br/>

                                                            He emphasized that while tribal regions often lack material
                                                            development, they are fertile ground for <em>krishna-bhakti.

                                                            Where the noise of materialism hasn’t reached, the holy name
                                                            can echo freely.Sri Akshayananda Dasa, a teacher from
                                                            Tripura, who now leads one of ITCT’s Nimai Pathshalas, told
                                                            us: “Our village once woke to the sound of conflict and
                                                            alcohol. Today, the morning begins with <em>japa,</em>
                                                            and the children chant <em>slokas</em>
                                                            instead of shouting. We’re living Srila Prabhupada’s
                                                            dream—one bead at a time.”<br/>

                                                            into seva. As Team ITCT put it: “A sewing machine is not

                                                            chant the holy names, her home transforms into a sacred
                                                            temple—an abode of Lord Krishna.”<br/>

                                                            but an offering to Krsna. “I had tears when I saw those
                                                            children chanting Sanskrit verses from Bhagavad-gita and

                                                            “This is not education—it is a return to the eternal

                                                            A volunteer Sri Tirth Harinaam Das remarked: “These weren’t
                                                            just eye camps—they were windows to compassion. For many, it
                                                            was the first time they felt honored, not just helped.”<br/>

                                                            providing a home where daily chanting, prasada, and Vedic
                                                            values are part of the children’s upbringing. And through

                                                            continues to demonstrate that material support and spiritual

                                                            At the closing session, Braja Vilas Dasa proposed that the
                                                            Tribal Convention be officially added to Mayapur’s annual
                                                            calendar. His words echoed a new recognition: “This is not a
                                                            social program—it is a spiritual uprising. “These devotees
                                                            may lack material comforts, but they are wealthy in

                                                            As the final <em>kirtana</em>
                                                            reverberated through the convention arena, one could feel
                                                            what Srila Prabhupada envisioned: a society where no one is
                                                            left behind in Krishna’s plan—a movement that embraces the
                                                            margins of society and places them at the center of

                                                            The Tribal Care initiative is now being called “A movement
                                                            within the movement.” More <em>pathasalas </em>
                                                            are being established, more tribal leaders are being
                                                            trained, and Krishna’s holy name is being carried deeper
                                                            into the forests, fields, and forgotten corners of Bharat.
                                                            “We are not here to convert anyone to a new faith,” said Sri
                                                            Govinda Dasa. “We are here to awaken the bhakti already
                                                            dormant in their hearts. This is reclamation, not
                                                            replacement.” As Srila Prabhupada said, “Krishna
                                                            consciousness is not an imposition on the mind. It is the
                                                            original energy of the living being.”<br/>
