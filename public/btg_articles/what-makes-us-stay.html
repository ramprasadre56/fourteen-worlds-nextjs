            <em>We remain in Krishna consciousness not because we are strong, but because we are supported by the right
                association.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>By Rakesh Roshan</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Recently, I met a devotee who had once been deeply immersed in Krishna Consciousness. He had served as a
            preacher in a youth group and practiced steadily for many years. But not anymore. He had turned to
            Christianity, despite being born into a Hindu family.
        </p>

        <p>
            I felt sad—but not surprised.
        </p>

        <p>
            This reminded me of the early days of ISKCON, when many devotees unexpectedly left. Some were shocked, but
            Srila Prabhupada brought clarity with one striking statement: "It is not surprising that people leave. The
            real surprise is that people stay."
        </p>

        <p>
            Maya Devi is extraordinarily powerful. She governs this world with two forces: prakshepatmika-sakti (that
            pushes us into illusion) and avaranatmika-sakti (that covers our true knowledge). With such forces at play,
            the real mystery is not departure—but perseverance.
        </p>

        <h3>The Question We Rarely Ask</h3>

        <p>
            I found myself wondering: What causes someone to leave a movement filled with joy, meaning, and spiritual
            ecstasy? Why didn't this friend seek guidance before shifting faith?
        </p>

        <p>
            Then came the real insight: The real question is not why someone leaves—but what keeps someone going in
            Krishna consciousness.
        </p>

        <p>
            Is it hope? Faith? Love? Whatever the driving force may be, that force determines whether one remains for a
            lifetime, for a season, or not at all.
        </p>

        <h3>Intent: The Silent Architect of Devotion</h3>

        <p>
            Scriptures record many who approached Krishna consciousness for material motives—wealth, influence,
            marriage, or prestige. Many received what they wanted and then left. Rarely did they recognize the futility
            of such desires before it was too late.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dhruva Maharaja began with the desire for a kingdom greater than his father's. Yet after seeing the Lord, he
            confessed: "I was searching for broken pieces of glass, but I found a diamond."
        </p>

        <h3>Where Does Intent Come From?</h3>

        <p>
            Actions stem from the mind. The mind shapes intentions. And intelligence governs the mind. Liberation is not
            suppression, but governance.
        </p>

        <h3>Purified Intelligence: The True Driver</h3>

        <p>
            Krishna explains in the Bhagavad-gita that lust resides in intelligence. When intelligence becomes impure,
            the mind misleads us—like a reckless charioteer losing control of the horses. A purified intelligence
            changes everything. Hearing and chanting the names and glories of Krishna do not merely inspire us—they
            purify intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
            Consider Mrigari the hunter. Once he took pleasure in half-killing animals. His logic seemed justified—until
            the words of Narada pierced his intelligence. His heart transformed instantly, and so did his life. Not
            through fear, but through awakened intent.
        </p>

        <h3>Association: The Critical Variable</h3>

        <p>
            In reflecting on my friend who left, I realized: perhaps if he had opened his heart to a pure devotee, or
            sought guidance at the right moment, he might still be practicing today. But the opportunity never came—or
            was never sought.
        </p>

        <p>
            This experience drove home an essential truth: We do not remain in Krishna consciousness because we are
            strong. We remain because we are supported.
        </p>

        <p>
            We need:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>mentors who correct us with compassion</li>
            <li>friends who nourish our intent</li>
            <li>guides who steady our intelligence during storms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Because in the end, it is not merely knowledge, not rituals, not even inspiration that keeps us going. It is
            purified intelligence — strengthened by the right association — guiding us to right action.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>That is what makes one stay.</strong>
